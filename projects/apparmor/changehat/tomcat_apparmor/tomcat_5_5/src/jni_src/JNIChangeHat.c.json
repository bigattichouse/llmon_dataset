    "summary": "This module provides a JNI (Java Native Interface) bridge for Java applications to interact with AppArmor's change_hat functionality. It allows Java code to change security contexts (hats) and return to previous security contexts, enabling fine-grained access control in Java applications like Tomcat.",

{"project":"sendmail","module":"smdb2.c","summary":"This module provides database functionality for sendmail using Berkeley DB (version 2 or higher) as the backend. It implements functions for database operations like open, close, get, put, delete, and cursor operations, translating between the SMDB database API and the specific Berkeley DB implementation.","logs":[{"function":"db_err_cb","message_template":"[Error messages from Berkeley DB are intentionally suppressed]","reason":"This function is registered as an error callback with Berkeley DB to deliberately suppress any error messages that would be generated by the DB library.","resolution":"If DB-related errors are not being reported, this is by design. To see DB errors, modify this function to pass the messages to an appropriate logging facility."}]}

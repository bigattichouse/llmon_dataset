{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/libsmdb\/smdb.c","summary":"This module provides a database abstraction layer for Sendmail, supporting operations like opening, locking, and unlocking databases of various types (NEWDB, NDBM, CDB, etc). It handles file permissions, extensions, and provides utilities for database management.","logs":[{"function":"smdb_lockfile","message_template":"cannot lockf(%s%s, fd=%d, type=%o, omode=%o, euid=%d)","reason":"This error occurs when a lockf operation fails when trying to lock a database file. The message is currently commented out in the code, but indicates a potential file locking issue.","resolution":"Check file permissions and ensure the process has appropriate access rights to the database file. Also verify the filesystem supports the locking mechanism being used."},{"function":"smdb_lockfile","message_template":"cannot flock(%s%s, fd=%d, type=%o, omode=%o, euid=%d)","reason":"This error occurs when an flock operation fails when trying to lock a database file.

Also verify the filesystem supports the flock locking mechanism."},{"function":"smdb_lockfile","message_template":"Invalid argument","reason":"This error might occur on SunOS when trying to lock a file on a filesystem mounted as type 'tmp'. The code specifically handles this case as a non-error.","resolution":"If this error appears outside of a SunOS system with tmp-mounted filesystem, it might indicate an actual problem with file locking arguments. Consider using a different filesystem for database files."},{"function":"smdb_add_extension","message_template":"%s.%s","reason":"This is a format string used to create a filename with an extension.

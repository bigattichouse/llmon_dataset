{"project":"sendmail","module":"libsmutil\/snprintf.c","summary":"This module provides utility functions for string formatting, specifically the 'shortenstring' function that truncates long strings to fit within a specified maximum length while preserving context by including portions from the beginning and end of the original string with ellipses between them.","logs":[{"function":"shortenstring","message_template":"...","reason":"This ellipsis is added to shortened strings to indicate truncation. It's not directly logged but is part of strings that may appear in logs when the function is used by logging code elsewhere.","resolution":"Not an error message, but rather a formatting indicator. If truncated strings in logs are causing issues with readability or information loss, consider increasing buffer sizes or log message length limits."}]}

{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/include\/sm\/debug.h","summary":"This module defines the debugging infrastructure for the sendmail library, providing functions and structures to manage debug levels, output files, and formatted debug messages. It implements a flexible debug system where debug objects can be configured at runtime with different activation levels.","logs":[{"function":"sm_dprintf","message_template":"Variable - defined by _fmt parameter","reason":"Prints formatted debug messages to the current debug file. Used throughout the sendmail system to output debug information when specific debug settings are enabled.","resolution":"These are informational debug messages. If they appear too frequently, consider reducing the debug level in the sendmail configuration."},{"function":"SM_DEBUG_T structure","message_template":"@(#)$Debug: <name> - <short description> $","reason":"Stores a standardized description string for each debug object, providing a consistent way to identify what each debug setting controls.","resolution":"This is an informational template used internally for debug structure identification. No resolution required."},{"function":"sm_debug_addsettings_x","message_template":"No direct message, but controls what debug messages appear","reason":"Adds multiple debug settings from a configuration string, which determines what debug messages will be generated during execution.","resolution":"If undesired debug messages are appearing in logs, check the debug settings configuration and adjust as needed."},{"function":"sm_debug_addsetting_x","message_template":"No direct message, but controls debug message visibility","reason":"Sets a specific debug object's level, controlling whether its associated debug messages will be generated.","resolution":"To control verbose logging, adjust the debug levels in sendmail configuration to only enable what's necessary for troubleshooting."}]}

{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/include\/sm\/assert.h","summary":"This module provides assertion checking and abnormal program termination capabilities for the Sendmail project. It defines macros like SM_REQUIRE, SM_ENSURE, and SM_ASSERT which verify conditions and terminate the program with an error message if the condition fails.","logs":[{"function":"SM_REQUIRE macro","message_template":"SM_REQUIRE(cond) failed","reason":"This message is generated when a precondition check fails, indicating that a function was called with invalid parameters or in an invalid state.","resolution":"Check the specific condition that failed and ensure all function prerequisites are met before calling. This typically indicates a programming error that needs to be fixed in the code."},{"function":"SM_ENSURE macro","message_template":"SM_ENSURE(cond) failed","reason":"This message is generated when a postcondition check fails, indicating that a function could not fulfill its contract or produced an unexpected result.","resolution":"Examine the function logic to understand why the expected postcondition wasn't satisfied. This may indicate a bug in the function implementation or misunderstanding of its behavior."},{"function":"SM_ASSERT macro","message_template":"SM_ASSERT(cond) failed","reason":"This message is generated when a general assertion fails, indicating an unexpected state or invariant violation in the program.","resolution":"Review the specific assertion condition and the surrounding code context. This indicates a programming error or unexpected runtime condition that needs to be addressed."},{"function":"sm_abort","message_template":"Custom error message (variable)","reason":"This function is called to terminate the program with a custom error message, typically indicating a fatal error condition.","resolution":"The resolution depends on the specific error message. This function is used for custom error handling, so check the error message for details about what went wrong."},{"function":"sm_abort_at","message_template":"File: %s, Line: %d, Message: %s","reason":"This function is called to terminate the program with file, line number, and error message information, providing context about where the error occurred.","resolution":"Check the file and line number in the error message to locate the exact point of failure. The message will indicate which assertion failed and help identify the underlying issue."}]}

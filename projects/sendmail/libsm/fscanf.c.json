{"project":"sendmail","module":"fscanf.c","summary":"This module provides file scanning functionality for the sendmail project, specifically implementing a formatted scan function (sm_io_fscanf) that reads input from a file and converts it according to a specified format, similar to the standard C fscanf function but with sendmail-specific features.","logs":[{"function":"sm_io_fscanf","message_template":"SM_REQUIRE_ISA assertion failure","reason":"An assertion failure might occur if the file pointer does not match the expected SmFileMagic type, indicating that an invalid file handle was passed to the function","resolution":"Check that the file pointer passed to sm_io_fscanf is valid and was properly initialized using the appropriate sendmail file opening functions"}]}

{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/libsm\/t-str2prt.c","summary":"This module contains test code for the str2prt() function, which handles meta-character quoting in strings. It runs a series of test cases comparing expected outputs with actual function results, and reports failures when they occur.","logs":[{"function":"main","message_template":"test meta quoting","reason":"Indicates the start of a test suite for meta character quoting in strings. This is used as the test name in the test framework.","resolution":"This is an informational message used to identify the test being run. No resolution required."},{"function":"main","message_template":"in: %s\n","reason":"Logs the input string when a test case fails and verbose mode is enabled. Helps debug issues with string processing.","resolution":"Check why the str2prt() function is not properly handling the reported input string. Possible issues include improper handling of escape characters or bugs in the quoting implementation."},{"function":"main","message_template":"got: %s\n","reason":"Logs the actual output from str2prt() when a test case fails and verbose mode is enabled. Shows what the function actually produced.","resolution":"Compare with the expected output to identify discrepancies. Fix the str2prt() function to properly handle meta-character quoting for the specific input case."},{"function":"main","message_template":"exp: %s\n","reason":"Logs the expected output when a test case fails and verbose mode is enabled. Shows what the function should have produced.","resolution":"Compare with the actual output to identify discrepancies. This is a test expectation, so if it's incorrect, the test case may need to be updated."},{"function":"main","message_template":"cmp=%d\n","reason":"Logs the comparison result between expected and actual output when a test case fails and verbose mode is enabled. A non-zero value indicates a mismatch.","resolution":"This diagnostic provides additional information about the comparison. The value should match the expected result in the test case. If not, either the test case or the str2prt() implementation needs to be corrected."}]}

{"project":"sendmail","module":"vasprintf.c","summary":"This module provides the sm_vasprintf function which dynamically allocates a string buffer and writes formatted output to it, similar to the standard C library's vasprintf function. It handles memory allocation and performs error checking for allocation failures.","logs":[{"function":"sm_vasprintf","message_template":"Memory allocation failure in sm_vasprintf","reason":"This error occurs when the sm_malloc function fails to allocate memory for the buffer. Likely due to the system running out of memory.","resolution":"Check system memory usage and consider increasing available memory. If the issue persists, investigate for memory leaks in the application."},{"function":"sm_vasprintf","message_template":"Memory reallocation failure in sm_vasprintf","reason":"This error occurs when the sm_realloc function fails to resize the allocated buffer. This could happen if the system is low on memory.","resolution":"Check system memory usage and consider increasing available memory. If the issue persists, investigate for memory leaks in the application."},{"function":"sm_vasprintf","message_template":"Formatting error in sm_vasprintf","reason":"This error occurs when sm_io_vfprintf returns -1, indicating a failure in formatting the string. This could be due to invalid format specifiers or other formatting issues.","resolution":"Check the format string and ensure all format specifiers match the variable arguments provided. Also verify that the variable arguments are of the correct type for the format specifiers."}]}

{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/libsm\/get.c","summary":"This module provides a function version of the sm_io_getc macro for getting a character from a file with timeout support. It's part of the sendmail libsm library and includes thread-safety considerations.","logs":[{"function":"sm_io_getc","message_template":"SM_REQUIRE_ISA validation failure","reason":"This would occur if the file pointer passed to sm_io_getc is not of the expected type (SmFileMagic). The macro might log an error or abort execution.","resolution":"Ensure that only valid SM_FILE_T pointers that were properly initialized are passed to sm_io_getc. Check if the file was properly opened and not corrupted."}]}

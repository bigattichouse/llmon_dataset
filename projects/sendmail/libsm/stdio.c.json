{"project":"sendmail","module":"libsm\/stdio.c","summary":"This module provides standard I\/O functionality for the Sendmail library, implementing operations similar to stdio in libc with file open, read, write, seek, and close operations. It maintains a 'known seek offset' for optimization and supports various file access modes.","logs":[{"function":"sm_io_fopen","message_template":"sm_io_fopen: bad flags 0%o","reason":"The function aborts execution when invalid file opening flags are provided. This occurs when the O_ACCMODE bits in the flags parameter don't match any of the expected values (O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, O_RDWR).","resolution":"Check the flags parameter passed to sm_io_fopen to ensure it contains valid access mode flags (O_RDONLY, O_WRONLY, or O_RDWR). This is a programming error that requires code modification, not a runtime configuration issue."}]}

{"project":"sendmail","module":"signal.c","summary":"This module provides cross-platform signal handling functionality for sendmail, including functions to set signal handlers, block\/release signals, and manage pending signals during critical sections. It abstracts the differences between various Unix signal implementations.","logs":[{"function":"pend_signal","message_template":"Abnormal program termination (abort called)","reason":"The function received an unexpected signal type that it doesn't know how to handle. This triggers an abort() call which terminates the program. This would likely occur if the signal handling code is called with signal numbers that were not anticipated by the developers.","resolution":"This is a code-level issue. If this occurs, check which signals are being passed to the signal handling code and ensure they match what the code expects (SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGUSR1, SIGALRM). The application may need to be modified to handle additional signal types."}]}

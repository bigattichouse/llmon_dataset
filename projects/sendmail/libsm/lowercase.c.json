{"project":"sendmail","module":"libsm\/lowercase.c","summary":"This module provides functions for string case conversion, with special handling for internationalized (UTF-8) strings. It includes utilities to check if strings are ASCII and functions to convert strings to lowercase for both ASCII and UTF-8 encoded text.","logs":[{"function":"sm_lowercase","message_template":"ucasemap_open error: %s","reason":"This error would be logged when the Unicode case mapping initialization fails. This could happen due to problems with ICU library initialization or an invalid locale specification.","resolution":"Verify that the ICU library is properly installed and that the locale 'en_US' is available on the system. Check if there are any resource constraints preventing proper initialization of Unicode services."},{"function":"sm_lowercase","message_template":"conversion error for \"%s\": %s","reason":"This error would be logged when UTF-8 string case conversion fails after multiple attempts. This could happen due to malformed UTF-8 input or internal Unicode conversion errors.","resolution":"Inspect the input string to ensure it contains valid UTF-8 encoded text. If the input is coming from an external source, add additional validation before attempting case conversion. Update the ICU library if outdated."}]}

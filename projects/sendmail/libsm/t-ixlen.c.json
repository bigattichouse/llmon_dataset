{"project":"sendmail","module":"libsm\/t-ixlen.c","summary":"A test module for validating the functionality of character length calculation functions (ilenx, xleni) in sendmail. It provides several test routines to ensure proper handling of string length calculations when dealing with internal character representations.","logs":[{"function":"chkilenx","message_template":"str=\"%s\", len=%d, expected=%d\n","reason":"Logs an error when the actual length calculated by ilenx() differs from the expected length. This indicates a potential issue with the ilenx() function's calculation.","resolution":"Review the implementation of ilenx() function and verify the string input. Check if the character encoding or special character handling has changed."},{"function":"chkilen","message_template":"str=\"%s\", ilen=%d, xlen=%d\n","reason":"Provides debug information in verbose mode, showing the input string and calculated lengths using different methods.","resolution":"Informational log, no resolution required.

{"project":"sendmail","module":"fpurge.c","summary":"This module implements a buffer purging function (sm_io_purge) that empties a file buffer without committing its content. It's a utility function for file I\/O operations in the sendmail system.","logs":[{"function":"sm_io_purge","message_template":"Invalid file pointer (failed SM_REQUIRE_ISA assertion)","reason":"The function was called with a file pointer that doesn't have the expected type signature. This likely indicates a programming error where an invalid or corrupted file handle was passed to the function.","resolution":"Check for null pointers or improperly initialized file handles in the calling code. Ensure that the file was properly opened before attempting to purge it."},{"function":"sm_io_purge","message_template":"EBADF (Bad file descriptor)","reason":"The function was called with a file pointer that doesn't have its flags set, indicating the file is not properly initialized or may have been already closed.","resolution":"Verify that the file is open before calling this function and that no operations are performed on closed files. This typically requires a code fix to ensure proper file handle management."},{"function":"SM_RCSID","message_template":"@(#)$Id: fpurge.c,v 1.21 2013-11-22 20:51:42 ca Exp $","reason":"This is a version identification string that might appear in version information logs or when querying the binary for embedded version details.","resolution":"Informational only, no resolution required.

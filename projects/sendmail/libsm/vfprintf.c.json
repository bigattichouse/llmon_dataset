{"project":"sendmail","module":"libsm\/vfprintf.c","summary":"This module implements the core formatting functionality for printf-style functions in sendmail's libsm library. It handles format string parsing, argument processing, and output generation similar to the standard C library's vfprintf.","logs":[{"function":"sm_io_vfprintf","message_template":"bug in sm_io_vfprintf: bad base","reason":"This error occurs when an invalid base (not OCT, DEC, or HEX) is provided for number conversion, indicating an internal bug in the formatting code rather than a user error.","resolution":"This is a critical internal error that should not occur in normal operation. If encountered, it suggests a programming error in sendmail's code that would require a fix in the source code. Report this to sendmail developers with details on the operation being performed."}]}

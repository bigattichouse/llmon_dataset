{"project":"sendmail","module":"fclose.c","summary":"This module handles closing file descriptors with timeout capabilities as part of Sendmail's IO abstraction layer. It provides a safe mechanism to close files with configurable timeout limits, preventing operations from hanging indefinitely.","logs":[{"function":"sm_io_close","message_template":"File descriptor invalid","reason":"Raised when a NULL file pointer is passed to the close function, indicating an invalid file descriptor. Likely occurs when attempting to close a file that was never opened or has already been closed.","resolution":"Check the code path to ensure the file pointer is valid before attempting to close it. Verify that the file is properly initialized and hasn't been previously closed."},{"function":"sm_io_close","message_template":"File not open","reason":"Raised when the file's magic number is NULL, indicating the file is not actually open. This could happen when trying to close a file that was never successfully opened or has already been closed.","resolution":"Verify that the file was properly opened before attempting to close it. Check for duplicate close operations on the same file descriptor."},{"function":"sm_io_close","message_template":"No close function available","reason":"Raised when the file structure doesn't have a close function defined. This likely indicates a programming error or corruption of the file structure.","resolution":"This is likely a programming error within the Sendmail codebase. Check if custom file types have properly implemented close functions."},{"function":"sm_io_close","message_template":"Close operation timed out","reason":"Raised when the file close operation exceeds the specified timeout. This can happen when the underlying filesystem is slow or unresponsive, potentially due to network issues with NFS or other remote filesystems.","resolution":"Check for filesystem issues, particularly with network-mounted volumes. Consider increasing the timeout value if closing specific types of files consistently takes longer than expected."},{"function":"sm_io_close","message_template":"Close function failed","reason":"Raised when the underlying close function returns an error. This could indicate filesystem errors, disk full conditions, or other I\/O problems.","resolution":"Check system logs for filesystem errors. Verify that the disk isn't full and that there are no permission issues or filesystem corruption."}]}

{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/libsm\/fwrite.c","summary":"This module implements sm_io_write, a function for writing data to a file pointer. It sets up the appropriate structures and delegates to sm_fvwrite for the actual writing, then returns the number of bytes written or 0 on failure with errno set.","logs":[{"function":"sm_io_write","message_template":"SM_REQUIRE_ISA failure","reason":"This would occur if the file pointer passed to sm_io_write doesn't match the expected SmFileMagic type, likely indicating a corrupted or invalid file handle.","resolution":"Check that the file handle being passed to sm_io_write is valid and properly initialized. The caller should ensure proper file opening before attempting to write."},{"function":"sm_io_write","message_template":"ENODEV error","reason":"Generated when the file pointer's write function (f_write) is NULL, indicating that the file doesn't support write operations.","resolution":"Check that the file was opened in a mode that permits writing. Some files might be read-only or the file handle might not be properly initialized for writing operations."}]}

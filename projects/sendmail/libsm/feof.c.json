{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/libsm\/feof.c","summary":"This module provides a function to test if a file has reached its end (EOF). It contains a simple wrapper function sm_io_eof that validates the file pointer and then calls the sm_eof macro to determine if the file is at EOF.","logs":[{"function":"sm_io_eof","message_template":"SM_REQUIRE_ISA assertion failure","reason":"Logs an error when the file pointer does not match the expected SmFileMagic type. This likely happens when an invalid or corrupted file pointer is passed to the function.","resolution":"Check the validity of file pointers before passing them to sm_io_eof. Make sure files are properly opened and not already closed."}]}

{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/libsm\/t-memstat.c","summary":"A test program for the memstat module in Sendmail that allows opening a memory statistics session, retrieving memory statistics for a specified resource, allocating memory to observe changes, and closing the session.","logs":[{"function":"main","message_template":"strdup(%s) failed\n","reason":"Logs an error when the program fails to allocate memory for duplicating the resource name provided with -r option. Likely due to memory shortage on the system.","resolution":"Check system memory resources, reduce memory pressure on the system, or allocate more memory to the process."},{"function":"main","message_template":"open=%d, memstat=%d, %s=%ld\n","reason":"Displays the results of memory statistics operations, including the return code from opening the statistics session, the return code from getting statistics, the resource name, and the memory value.","resolution":"Informational log, no resolution required. Useful for monitoring memory usage."},{"function":"main","message_template":"malloc(%d) failed\n","reason":"Logs an error when the program fails to allocate the requested memory amount during testing. Likely due to memory shortage on the system or requesting too large an amount.","resolution":"Check system memory resources, reduce the memory allocation size requested with -m option, or allocate more memory to the process."}]}

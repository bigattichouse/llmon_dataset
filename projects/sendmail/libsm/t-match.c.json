{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/libsm\/t-match.c","summary":"This is a test module for the sm_match() function in the libsm library of sendmail, which tests string pattern matching functionality with various test cases. When a test fails, it logs the input strings and the actual result.","logs":[{"function":"main","message_template":"sm_match(\"%s\", \"%s\") returns %s\n","reason":"This message is logged when the actual result of sm_match() doesn't match the expected result during testing. It provides debug information about the input string, pattern, and the actual result.","resolution":"This is a test framework message indicating a test failure. If seen in production, it would indicate that the pattern matching function is not working as expected. Review the pattern and string being matched to understand why the match operation is producing unexpected results."}]}

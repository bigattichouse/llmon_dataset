{"project":"sendmail","module":"libsm\/fvwrite.c","summary":"Implements sm_fvwrite, a function for writing memory regions and buffers to file pointers with different buffering modes. Handles unbuffered, line-buffered, and fully-buffered I\/O with timeout management and error handling.","logs":[{"function":"sm_fvwrite","message_template":"File descriptor not writable","reason":"Occurs when attempting to write to a file pointer that can't be written to, setting errno to EBADF and returning SM_IO_EOF. Likely due to a closed or invalid file descriptor.","resolution":"Check that the file descriptor is open, valid, and has write permissions. This could happen if the file was previously closed or if it was opened in read-only mode."},{"function":"sm_fvwrite","message_template":"Memory allocation failure","reason":"Occurs when sm_realloc fails to allocate memory during buffer expansion, setting errno to ENOMEM. Likely due to system running out of memory.","resolution":"Check system memory resources, reduce memory usage in other parts of the application, or consider tuning system memory parameters. May require increasing swap space or available RAM."},{"function":"sm_fvwrite","message_template":"Write operation error or timeout","reason":"Occurs when the underlying write operation returns an error or times out. This can happen due to disk full conditions, I\/O errors, or network timeouts.","resolution":"Check disk space, file system health, and network connectivity if writing to a network file system. May require increasing timeouts if the system is under heavy load."}]}

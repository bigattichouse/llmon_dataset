{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/libsm\/wsetup.c","summary":"This module provides the sm_wsetup function which checks if it's safe to write to a file pointer by validating file flags and preparing buffers. It's used by various output routines and the 'cantwrite' macro to ensure proper file stream setup before writing operations.","logs":[{"function":"sm_wsetup","message_template":"errno = EBADF","reason":"Sets the errno to EBADF (Bad file descriptor) when attempting to write to a file that is neither opened for writing nor for reading and writing. This occurs when file permission checks fail.","resolution":"Check that the file is opened with appropriate permissions (write or read\/write mode). This may require reopening the file with the correct access mode or checking file permissions."}]}

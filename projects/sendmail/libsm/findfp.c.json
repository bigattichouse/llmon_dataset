{"project":"sendmail","module":"findfp.c","summary":"This module provides functionality for file pointer management in the sendmail I\/O system. It defines various file types, handles initialization of the I\/O system, and provides functions for allocating and managing file pointers.","logs":[{"function":"sm_moreglue_x","message_template":"Memory allocation failure","reason":"This function may raise an exception if memory allocation fails when trying to allocate space for additional file pointers","resolution":"Check system memory resources. The application might be trying to open too many files or memory might be limited."},{"function":"sm_fp","message_template":"Invalid file type configuration","reason":"The function requires that the file type being opened has valid open, close, and read\/write functions defined","resolution":"This is likely a programming error. The file type configuration needs to be corrected to include all required function pointers."},{"function":"sm_cleanup","message_template":"Error flushing open files during cleanup","reason":"This function is called when the program exits to flush all open files, which might fail for various reasons","resolution":"Check for file system issues or premature program termination that might prevent proper flushing of file buffers."},{"function":"sm_io_setinfo","message_template":"Invalid 'what' parameter or missing setinfo vector","reason":"The function returns -1 and sets errno when given an invalid 'what' parameter or when the file type doesn't support the requested operation","resolution":"Ensure the correct 'what' parameter is being used for the file type, or check if the file type supports the requested operation."},{"function":"sm_io_getinfo","message_template":"NULL value pointer for vector or type request","reason":"The function returns -1 and sets errno when a NULL value pointer is provided for a request that requires a non-NULL pointer","resolution":"Ensure a valid pointer is provided when making requests that require one, such as SM_IO_WHAT_VECTORS or SM_IO_WHAT_ISTYPE."},{"function":"sm_io_getinfo","message_template":"Unsupported information request","reason":"The function returns -1 and sets errno when the file type doesn't support the requested information operation","resolution":"Check if the file type supports the specific information request, or use a different approach to get the needed information."}]}

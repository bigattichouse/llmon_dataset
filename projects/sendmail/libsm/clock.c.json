{"project":"sendmail","module":"clock.c","summary":"This module implements timing and event scheduling functionality for sendmail, including a clock event queue system, custom sleep implementation, and timer management that allows scheduling actions to occur at specific times.","logs":[{"function":"sleep","message_template":"sleep: interval=%u exceeds max value %d","reason":"Logs an error when the requested sleep interval exceeds the maximum allowed value. This is likely a safeguard against excessively long sleep intervals which could cause operational issues.","resolution":"Modify the application to use shorter sleep intervals or adjust the _FFR_MAX_SLEEP_TIME configuration parameter if longer sleep intervals are required for legitimate operational needs."},{"function":"sleep","message_template":"sleep: sm_setevent(%u) failed","reason":"Logs an error when the system fails to set an event for sleep. This could occur due to memory allocation failures or other system resource constraints.","resolution":"Check system memory and resource usage. The error is currently commented out, but if enabled, it would indicate a serious resource constraint in the system that needs addressing."}]}

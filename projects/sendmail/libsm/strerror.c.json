{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/libsm\/strerror.c","summary":"This module provides a fallback implementation of the strerror function for platforms that lack it. It translates error numbers to human-readable messages, returning either a standard error message from sys_errlist or a generic 'Error %d' message for unknown error codes.","logs":[{"function":"strerror","message_template":"Error %d","reason":"This message is generated when an error number outside the range of known system errors is encountered. It's used as a fallback when the error code cannot be mapped to a specific error message.","resolution":"This is not an actual logged error but rather a message template that might be used in logs elsewhere. If you see this in logs, it indicates that the code encountered an unknown error number. Consult the platform's error code documentation or check for application-specific error codes."}]}

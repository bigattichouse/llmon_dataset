{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/libsm\/fprintf.c","summary":"This module provides a formatted printing function (sm_io_fprintf) to a file pointer, similar to standard fprintf but with timeout capability. It acts as a wrapper around sm_io_vfprintf, handling variable arguments before passing them to the actual formatting function.","logs":[{"function":"sm_io_fprintf","message_template":"SmFileMagic assertion failure","reason":"This error would occur if the file pointer passed to sm_io_fprintf is not of the expected type (SmFileMagic). Likely due to an invalid file handle or memory corruption.","resolution":"Check that the file handle being passed to sm_io_fprintf is valid and properly initialized. Ensure that no memory corruption has occurred and that the file has been properly opened using the appropriate Sendmail SM_FILE_T functions."},{"function":"sm_io_fprintf","message_template":"SM_IO_EOF","reason":"Function returns SM_IO_EOF when it fails to write to the file pointer. This could be due to I\/O errors, invalid file pointer, or timeout issues.","resolution":"Check the file system for errors, verify that the file is still accessible and writable, and ensure that the timeout value provided is sufficient for the operation to complete."}]}

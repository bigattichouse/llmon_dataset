{"project":"sendmail","module":"ungetc.c","summary":"This module implements buffered ungetc functionality for the libsm I\/O system in sendmail. It provides the ability to push a character back into the input stream, with dynamic buffer expansion when needed.","logs":[{"function":"sm_submore_x","message_template":"Out of memory","reason":"The function fails to allocate memory with sm_malloc_x when expanding the ungetc buffer.","resolution":"Increase available system memory or reduce memory usage in the application.

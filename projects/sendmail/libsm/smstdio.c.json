{"project":"sendmail","module":"libsm\/smstdio.c","summary":"This module implements a wrapper around the standard C I\/O library (stdio) for the sendmail system. It provides an abstraction layer that allows sendmail to use a consistent I\/O interface while leveraging the system's stdio implementation underneath, handling file operations such as open, read, write, seek, and close.","logs":[{"function":"setup","message_template":"fp->f_ival=%d: out of range (0...2)","reason":"This error occurs when the file pointer's internal value (f_ival) is not 0, 1, or 2 when trying to map to stdin, stdout, or stderr respectively. This indicates a serious programming error or memory corruption.","resolution":"This is a critical internal error that requires code debugging. It suggests a bug in the sendmail code where an invalid file descriptor value was assigned. The application will abort when this occurs, so immediate investigation is required."},{"function":"sm_io_stdioopen","message_template":"sm_io_stdioopen: mode '%s' is bad","reason":"This error occurs when an invalid file mode is provided to the sm_io_stdioopen function. The function only accepts 'r', 'w', or 'a' as the first character of the mode string.","resolution":"Check the file mode parameter being passed to sm_io_stdioopen. Valid mode strings should start with 'r' (read), 'w' (write), or 'a' (append). This indicates a programming error that needs to be fixed in the calling code."}]}

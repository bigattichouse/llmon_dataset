{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/libsm\/fread.c","summary":"This module provides the sm_io_read function, which reads data from a file pointer with timeout support. It handles partial reads, refilling buffers when necessary, and returns the number of whole chunks read or 0 on failure with errno set.","logs":[{"function":"sm_io_read","message_template":"ENODEV errno set when fp->f_read is NULL","reason":"The file pointer does not support read operations. This occurs when attempting to read from a file pointer that was not properly initialized for reading or is of a type that doesn't support read operations.","resolution":"Check that the file was opened with read permissions and that the file pointer is valid. This could indicate a programming error where the wrong file handle is being used."},{"function":"sm_io_read","message_template":"Partial read result returned","reason":"The requested amount of data could not be fully read. This happens when EOF is reached before filling the buffer, or when using SMNOW flag which takes whatever is immediately available.","resolution":"This may be normal behavior at end-of-file. Application code should check the return value to determine if a complete read was performed and handle partial reads appropriately."}]}

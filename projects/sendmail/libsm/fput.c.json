{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/libsm\/fput.c","summary":"This module provides functionality for writing strings to a file buffer in the sendmail libsm library. It contains a single function sm_io_fputs which adds a given string to the buffer for a file pointer, utilizing underlying IO vector operations.","logs":[{"function":"sm_io_fputs","message_template":"SM_REQUIRE_ISA assertion failed: fp does not have SmFileMagic","reason":"The file pointer fp does not have the expected SmFileMagic marker, indicating it might not be a valid file handle or has been corrupted.","resolution":"Check if the file pointer was properly initialized or wasn't closed prematurely. Ensure the application is using the proper file handling functions."},{"function":"sm_io_fputs","message_template":"String write operation failed","reason":"The underlying sm_fvwrite function failed to write the string to the buffer, potentially due to I\/O errors or buffer full conditions.","resolution":"Check disk space, file permissions, and whether the file is writable. If it's a network file, check network connectivity."}]}

{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/libsm\/ferror.c","summary":"This module provides a function implementation for checking error states on file pointers in the libsm library of the sendmail project. It defines the sm_io_error function which is a subroutine version of a macro with the same name, used to determine if a file pointer is in an error state.","logs":[{"function":"sm_io_error","message_template":"Invalid file pointer type","reason":"The SM_REQUIRE_ISA macro checks if the file pointer is of the expected SmFileMagic type. If not, it may generate an assertion failure or error message.","resolution":"Ensure that the file pointer passed to sm_io_error is properly initialized and of the correct type. Check if the file was opened correctly and hasn't been corrupted or closed prematurely."}]}

{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/libsm\/cf.c","summary":"This module provides functionality to read and parse options from the sendmail configuration file (sendmail.cf). It extracts option values specified by 'O' directives and stores them in an option vector provided by the caller.","logs":[{"function":"sm_cf_getopt","message_template":"File open error","reason":"The function fails to open the sendmail.cf file at the specified path. This could occur if the file doesn't exist, is not readable, or due to insufficient permissions.","resolution":"Check file path, permissions, and ensure the sendmail.cf file exists and is readable by the application. The specific error code (errno) will contain details about the exact cause."},{"function":"sm_cf_getopt","message_template":"I\/O error while reading configuration file","reason":"An I\/O error occurred while reading from the sendmail.cf file. This could be due to disk issues, file corruption, or a file system problem.","resolution":"Check the sendmail.cf file integrity, disk space, and file system health. The specific error code (errno) will provide more details about the exact I\/O error."},{"function":"sm_cf_getopt","message_template":"Memory allocation failure","reason":"The function couldn't allocate memory to store option values. This occurs when sm_strdup_x fails to duplicate a string due to insufficient memory.","resolution":"Check system memory availability and consider allocating more resources to the application or optimizing memory usage elsewhere."}]}

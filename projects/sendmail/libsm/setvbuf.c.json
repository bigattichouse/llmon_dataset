{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/libsm\/setvbuf.c","summary":"This module implements buffer configuration for file I\/O in the sendmail codebase. The sm_io_setvbuf function configures buffering modes for file streams, handling buffer allocation, and setting appropriate flags based on the requested mode.","logs":[{"function":"sm_io_setvbuf","message_template":"assertion failure: fp is not a valid SmFile","reason":"This error would occur if the SM_REQUIRE_ISA macro fails because the file pointer (fp) passed to sm_io_setvbuf is not a valid SmFile object. This indicates a programming error where an invalid pointer is being used.","resolution":"Check the code that calls sm_io_setvbuf to ensure it always passes a valid file handle obtained from proper file opening functions. This is likely a code bug rather than a configuration issue."}]}

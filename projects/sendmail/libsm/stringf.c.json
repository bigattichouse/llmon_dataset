{"project":"sendmail","module":"libsm\/stringf.c","summary":"This module provides functions for creating dynamically allocated formatted strings similar to printf. It contains sm_stringf_x and sm_vstringf_x which allocate memory for the formatted string and throw exceptions when memory allocation fails.","logs":[{"function":"sm_vstringf_x","message_template":"F:sm_heap","reason":"Raised when sm_vasprintf fails with ENOMEM, indicating the system is out of memory while trying to allocate space for a formatted string.","resolution":"Increase the available memory on the system, reduce memory consumption in other parts of the application, or check for memory leaks."},{"function":"sm_vstringf_x","message_template":"sm_vasprintf","reason":"Raised when sm_vasprintf fails for reasons other than out of memory, possibly due to invalid format specifiers or system resource issues.","resolution":"Check that the format string and arguments passed to the formatting function are valid and follow the expected formats. Also investigate system resource issues that might affect memory allocation."}]}

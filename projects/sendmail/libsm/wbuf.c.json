{"project":"sendmail","module":"libsm\/wbuf.c","summary":"This module implements a write buffer function for the Sendmail I\/O subsystem. It handles writing characters to a buffer, flushing the buffer when necessary, and managing line-buffered and unbuffered I\/O operations.","logs":[{"function":"sm_wbuf","message_template":"Bad file descriptor","reason":"Returned when attempting to write to a file that is not writable. This occurs when the cantwrite() check fails, indicating the file descriptor is invalid or not open for writing.","resolution":"Check file permissions and ensure the file is properly opened with write access. Verify that the file descriptor hasn't been closed prematurely."},{"function":"sm_wbuf","message_template":"Flush failure","reason":"Returned when the function fails to flush the buffer. This could happen due to disk space issues, permission problems, or underlying I\/O errors.","resolution":"Check disk space, file system permissions, and system I\/O status. The specific error reason will be in errno, which should be examined for troubleshooting."}]}

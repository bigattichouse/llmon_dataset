{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/libsm\/clrerr.c","summary":"This module provides functionality to clear error indicators on file pointers. It contains a wrapper function sm_io_clearerr that calls sm_clearerr after verifying the file pointer is valid.","logs":[{"function":"sm_io_clearerr","message_template":"assertion \"fp->_magic == SmFileMagic\" failed","reason":"The function received an invalid file pointer that doesn't have the expected magic number, indicating it's not a proper SM_FILE_T structure.","resolution":"Check for NULL pointers or improperly initialized file handles before calling sm_io_clearerr. This could occur if the file pointer was corrupted or if memory was overwritten."}]}

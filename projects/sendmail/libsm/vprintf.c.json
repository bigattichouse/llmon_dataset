{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/libsm\/vprintf.c","summary":"This module implements the sm_vprintf function, which is a wrapper for printing formatted output to standard output with variable arguments. It uses an internal timeout mechanism and delegates to sm_io_vfprintf for the actual formatting and output.","logs":[{"function":"sm_vprintf","message_template":"Variable - determined by fmt parameter","reason":"Outputs formatted text to standard output based on the format string and variable arguments provided by the caller. The actual messages would be determined by the calling code.","resolution":"Information log, typically no resolution required. If problematic output appears, check the calling code that uses sm_vprintf."}]}

{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/libsm\/util.c","summary":"This module provides utility functions for string manipulation in the sendmail library, focusing on handling unprintable characters and quoting special internal characters. It includes functions to convert unprintable characters to octal escape sequences and to safely quote and dequote internal metacharacters.","logs":[{"function":"str2prt","message_template":"Memory allocation failure in str2prt","reason":"While not explicitly logged in this file, the sm_pmalloc_x function could fail if memory allocation is not possible, which would likely generate an error elsewhere in the codebase.","resolution":"Check system memory availability and consider increasing memory limits if this occurs frequently."},{"function":"quote_internal_chars","message_template":"Memory allocation failure in quote_internal_chars","reason":"Similar to str2prt, memory allocation failures in sm_rpool_malloc_tagged_x or sm_malloc_tagged_x would be handled elsewhere in the codebase.","resolution":"Review memory usage patterns and ensure sufficient memory is available for the application."}]}

{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/libsm\/t-heap.c","summary":"This module tests the heap handling functionality of the sendmail library, focusing on memory allocation, reallocation, and freeing operations. It includes conditional debug output to report on heap status and potential memory errors.","logs":[{"function":"main","message_template":"test heap handling","reason":"Identifies the beginning of the heap handling test suite to provide context for subsequent test results","resolution":"Informational log, no resolution required"},{"function":"main","message_template":"heap with 1 30-byte block allocated:\n","reason":"Logs the heap status after allocating and reallocating a memory block to 30 bytes, providing visibility into memory usage","resolution":"Informational log for debugging purposes, no resolution required unless excessive memory allocation is observed"},{"function":"main","message_template":"heap with 0 blocks allocated:\n","reason":"Logs the heap status after freeing all allocated memory, confirming proper memory deallocation","resolution":"Informational log for debugging purposes, no resolution required unless memory leaks are detected"},{"function":"main","message_template":"xtrap count = %d\n","reason":"Reports the count of memory allocation traps that were triggered during the test execution","resolution":"If the trap count is unexpectedly high, investigate potential memory mishandling in the application code"},{"function":"main","message_template":"about to free %p for the second time\n","reason":"Warning that the code is about to perform a double-free operation, which is an invalid memory operation that will cause a crash","resolution":"This is an intentional error case in a debug build. In production code, modify the application to track memory allocations more carefully to prevent double-free errors"}]}

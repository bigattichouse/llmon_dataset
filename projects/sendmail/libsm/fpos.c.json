{"project":"sendmail","module":"libsm\/fpos.c","summary":"This module implements file positioning functionality for the sendmail I\/O library. It provides functions to retrieve the current file position with support for timeouts, handling both read and write buffers correctly when determining the actual file position.","logs":[{"function":"sm_io_tell","message_template":"SM_REQUIRE_ISA(fp, SmFileMagic)","reason":"This assertion checks if the provided file pointer is valid and of the expected type. If it fails, the program might log an error or abort.","resolution":"Ensure the file pointer passed to sm_io_tell is properly initialized and not corrupted. Check for any earlier file operations that might have closed or invalidated the file pointer."},{"function":"sm_io_tell","message_template":"errno = ESPIPE","reason":"The function sets this error when the file pointer doesn't support seeking operations, which is a fundamental requirement for telling the position.","resolution":"This error occurs when attempting to get the position of a non-seekable file descriptor like a pipe or socket. Use sm_io_tell only with regular files or other seekable streams."},{"function":"sm_io_tell","message_template":"errno = EAGAIN (timeout == SM_TIME_IMMEDIATE)","reason":"The function immediately returns with EAGAIN when a zero timeout is specified, as the operation might take time to complete.","resolution":"If you need the file position, specify a reasonable timeout value or SM_TIME_FOREVER instead of SM_TIME_IMMEDIATE."},{"function":"sm_io_tell","message_template":"errno = EAGAIN (timeout occurred)","reason":"A timeout occurred while attempting to get the file position, likely during the flush or seek operation.","resolution":"Increase the timeout value if the system is under heavy load or if the file system is slow to respond. Check for system I\/O bottlenecks if this error occurs frequently."},{"function":"sm_io_tell","message_template":"pos = (*fp->f_seek)(fp, (off_t) 0, SM_IO_SEEK_CUR)","reason":"The underlying seek operation failed, which could be due to I\/O errors, invalid file descriptors, or other file system issues.","resolution":"Check if the file is still valid and accessible. Look for file system errors or disk problems if this error persists. Ensure the file hasn't been closed or corrupted by other operations."}]}

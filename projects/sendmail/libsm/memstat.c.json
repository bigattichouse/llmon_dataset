{"project":"sendmail","module":"memstat.c","summary":"The memstat.c module provides functions to retrieve system memory statistics using different mechanisms depending on the operating system (swapctl, kstat, or \/proc\/meminfo). It implements three primary functions to open, close, and retrieve memory statistics, returning appropriate error codes when operations fail.","logs":[{"function":"sm_memstat_open","message_template":"Failed to get page size with sysconf(_SC_PAGE_SIZE)","reason":"The sysconf call to get the system page size failed, which prevents memory calculations in USESWAPCTL implementations","resolution":"Check system configuration and available memory.

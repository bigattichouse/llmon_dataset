{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/test\/t_exclopen.c","summary":"This test program checks whether a system has secure behavior when using O_EXCL flag with symbolic links. It verifies that when a symbolic link points to a non-existent file, attempting to open it with O_CREAT|O_EXCL should fail for proper security.","logs":[{"function":"main","message_template":"Could not create %s->%s symlink: %d\n","reason":"This error occurs when the test program is unable to create a symbolic link. This might happen due to permission issues in the \/tmp directory or other file system constraints.","resolution":"Check permissions on the \/tmp directory and ensure the system allows symlink creation. The test cannot proceed without this capability."},{"function":"main","message_template":"%s already exists -- remove and try again.\n","reason":"This error occurs when the target file (Attackee) already exists, which would invalidate the test conditions. The file should not exist for the test to correctly evaluate the O_EXCL behavior.","resolution":"Remove the file mentioned in the error message from \/tmp and try running the test again. This is likely due to a previous test run that didn't clean up properly."},{"function":"main","message_template":"Weird.  Open failed but %s was created anyhow (errno = %d)\n","reason":"This indicates an unexpected behavior where the open() call failed but still created the target file. This is an inconsistent file system behavior that neither passes nor fails the security test clearly.","resolution":"Report this behavior to system administrators as it represents unexpected file system behavior. This might indicate a race condition or other system-level issue and should be investigated."},{"function":"main","message_template":"Good show!  Exclusive open works properly with symbolic links (errno = %d).\n","reason":"This success message indicates that the system correctly prevents opening a symbolic link with O_EXCL flag, which is the secure behavior. The system passed the security test.","resolution":"No action required. This is an informational message confirming that your system handles O_EXCL securely with symbolic links."},{"function":"main","message_template":"Weird.  Open succeeded but %s was not created\n","reason":"This unexpected behavior indicates that the open() call succeeded but didn't create the target file. This is contradictory to the expected behavior of O_CREAT flag.","resolution":"Report this behavior to system administrators as it represents incorrect file system behavior. The system is neither passing nor failing the security test in an expected way."},{"function":"main","message_template":"Bad news: you can do an exclusive open through a symbolic link\n","reason":"This message indicates a security vulnerability where the system allows exclusive file creation through a symbolic link. This can potentially be exploited in a race condition attack.","resolution":"As the following message suggests, define BOGUS_O_EXCL in conf.h for sendmail configuration to work around this vulnerability. This will make sendmail aware of the issue and use alternative methods to ensure file security."},{"function":"main","message_template":"\tBe sure you #define BOGUS_O_EXCL in conf.h\n","reason":"This is a configuration suggestion to work around the security vulnerability detected in the previous message. It advises setting a compile-time flag to handle the improper O_EXCL behavior.","resolution":"Edit the sendmail conf.h file to add or uncomment the BOGUS_O_EXCL definition. This will enable sendmail to use alternative methods for ensuring file security since the system's O_EXCL implementation is inadequate."}]}

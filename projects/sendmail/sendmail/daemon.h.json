{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/sendmail\/daemon.h","summary":"This header file defines data structures and interfaces for the daemon functionality in sendmail. It includes a daemon structure for managing socket connections, configuration parameters like listen queue size and buffer sizes, and a function for handling connection refusal.","logs":[{"function":"refuseconnections","message_template":"[Implementation not visible in header]","reason":"This function likely logs when connections are refused based on load average or other criteria, but the specific log messages are not visible in this header file.","resolution":"If connection refusal logs appear, check system load, connection limits, and overall server health. May need to adjust configuration parameters like refuseLA, queueLA, or delayLA in the daemon configuration."}]}

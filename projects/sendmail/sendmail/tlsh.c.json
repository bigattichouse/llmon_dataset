{"project":"sendmail","module":"tlsh.c","summary":"This module implements TLS-related functionality for sendmail, specifically handling certificate fingerprinting and DANE TLSA record verification. It provides utilities for converting between binary and hexadecimal formats, calculating message digests, and validating TLSA DNS records used in DANE authentication.","logs":[{"function":"dane_tlsa_chk","message_template":"TLSA=%s, len=%d, status=bogus","reason":"Logs a warning when a TLSA DNS record is too short (less than 4 bytes). This indicates a malformed or truncated DANE record which cannot be used for verification.","resolution":"Check the DNS configuration for the domain. The TLSA records may be incorrectly formatted or truncated. Verify the TLSA records using DNS tools such as 'dig' and ensure they comply with the DANE specification (RFC 6698)."},{"function":"dane_tlsa_chk","message_template":"TLSA=%s, type=%d-%d-%d:%02x, status=unsupported","reason":"Logs a notice when a TLSA record has valid length but uses an unsupported combination of usage, selector, and matching type parameters. This occurs when the TLSA record doesn't match the formats supported by the current implementation.","resolution":"Review the TLSA record parameters. The record might be valid according to the DANE specification but uses features not supported by this version of sendmail. Consider updating the TLSA records to use supported parameter combinations or upgrade sendmail if the configuration is required."}]}

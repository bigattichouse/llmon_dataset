It provides functions to record statistics for different mail events, clear statistics, and merge current statistics with a persistent statistics file.","logs":[{"function":"poststats","message_template":"poststats: %s: %s","reason":"Logs an informational message when unable to open the statistics file for writing. This occurs when the file cannot be accessed, doesn't exist, or has incorrect permissions.

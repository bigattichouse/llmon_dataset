{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/sendmail\/bf.c","summary":"This module implements a buffered file I\/O system that allows data to be stored in memory before being written to disk. It provides functions for opening, reading, writing, seeking, and committing buffered files.","logs":[{"function":"sm_bfopen","message_template":"sm_bfopen(%s)\n","reason":"Debug message indicating a buffered file is being opened with the specified filename. This is only logged when debug level 58 with verbosity 8 or higher is enabled.","resolution":"This is an informational debug message that doesn't indicate an error. No resolution required."},{"function":"sm_bfread","message_template":"sm_bfread(%s): to disk\n","reason":"Debug message indicating an attempt to read from a file that isn't on disk yet. This happens when trying to read past the in-memory buffer before the file has been committed to disk.","resolution":"This is an informational debug message. If seen frequently, consider increasing the buffer size or committing files to disk earlier to improve performance."},{"function":"sm_bfcommit","message_template":"bfcommit(%s): to disk\n","reason":"Debug message indicating a buffered file is being committed to disk with the specified filename. This happens when the file needs to be persistently stored.","resolution":"This is an informational debug message that doesn't indicate an error. No resolution required."},{"function":"sm_bfcommit","message_template":"bfcommit(): filemode %o flags %ld\n","reason":"Debug message showing the file mode and flags being used when committing a buffered file to disk. This provides detailed debugging information about file permissions and open flags.","resolution":"This is an informational debug message. If file permission issues occur, check these values to ensure they match expected permissions."}]}

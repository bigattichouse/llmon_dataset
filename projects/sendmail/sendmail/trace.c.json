{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/sendmail\/trace.c","summary":"This module implements trace flag handling for sendmail's debugging system. It parses both old-style (numeric) and new-style (pattern-based) trace flags and registers them with the debugging system, controlling what debug information gets logged elsewhere in the application.","logs":[{"function":"tTnewflag","message_template":"sm_debug_addsetting_x registration","reason":"Registers a debug setting with the specified pattern and level. This controls what will be logged elsewhere in the application when debug tracing is enabled.","resolution":"This is not a direct log message but a configuration action. If trace-related issues occur, check the trace flag syntax in configuration files or command line arguments. Valid formats include numeric flags, ranges, and pattern-based flags with optional level specifications."}]}

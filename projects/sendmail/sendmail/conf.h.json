{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/sendmail\/conf.h","summary":"This header file defines core configuration parameters, constants, limits, and compilation options for sendmail. It establishes sizes for buffers, message parts, and various data structures, along with conditional compilation flags that control the inclusion of features like MIME support and network protocols.","logs":[{"function":"compile-time","message_template":"MEMCHUNKSIZE must be at least MAXLINE","reason":"This compile-time error is triggered if the MEMCHUNKSIZE constant is defined to be smaller than MAXLINE. The memory allocation system requires chunks that can hold at least a maximum-sized line.","resolution":"Increase the value of MEMCHUNKSIZE in the configuration to be at least equal to MAXLINE before compiling sendmail."},{"function":"compile-time","message_template":"MAXQUEUEGROUPS must be less than BITMAPBITS","reason":"This compile-time error occurs if MAXQUEUEGROUPS is defined to be greater than or equal to BITMAPBITS. This constraint exists because queue groups are tracked using a bitmap data structure.","resolution":"Decrease the value of MAXQUEUEGROUPS to be less than BITMAPBITS, or increase BITMAPBITS if more queue groups are needed."}]}

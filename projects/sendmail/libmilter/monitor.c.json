{"project":"sendmail","module":"libmilter\/monitor.c","summary":"This module implements a thread monitoring system for sendmail's libmilter component, tracking thread execution times and terminating threads that exceed a configured maximum execution time. The monitoring occurs through a dedicated monitor thread that checks periodically for long-running threads and can force milter termination when timeouts are detected.","logs":[{"function":"mi_monitor_thread","message_template":"WARNING: monitor timeout triggered, now=%ld, end=%ld, tid=%ld, state=0x%x","reason":"This warning is logged when a thread's execution time exceeds the configured maximum execution time. The thread is likely hung or processing a large request that's taking too long.","resolution":"Investigate the thread identified in the log. Consider increasing the maximum execution time if legitimate operations are being terminated, or look for possible deadlocks or performance bottlenecks in the corresponding milter code. You might also need to inspect the network connection or mail data being processed by this specific thread."}]}

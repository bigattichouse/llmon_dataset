{"project":"sendmail","module":"..\/working\/sendmail\/libmilter\/main.c","summary":"This module provides core functionality for mail filtering (milter) registration and initialization in sendmail. It handles the registration of filter descriptions, connection setup, socket management, and parameters configuration for milter communication.","logs":[{"function":"smfi_register","message_template":"%s: smfi_register: version mismatch application: %d != milter: %d","reason":"Logs an error when there's a version mismatch between the application and the milter library. This occurs when an application is compiled against one version of the milter API but runs with a different version.","resolution":"Recompile the application against the correct version of the milter library. Ensure that the application is using compatible milter version headers that match the runtime environment."},{"function":"smfi_main","message_template":"%s: missing connection information","reason":"Logs a fatal error when trying to initialize the milter but the connection information (socket) has not been set. This happens when smfi_setconn() was not called before smfi_main() or was called with invalid parameters.","resolution":"Ensure that smfi_setconn() is called with a valid socket specification (e.g., 'unix:\/path\/to\/socket' or 'inet:port@host') before calling smfi_main(). Check the application's initialization sequence."},{"function":"smfi_main","message_template":"%s: Couldn't start signal thread","reason":"Logs a fatal error when the library fails to create a thread for handling control signals. This could be due to resource constraints or permission issues.","resolution":"Check for system resource limitations such as max thread count. Verify that the system has sufficient memory available. It might also help to reduce the system load if it's running many processes already."}]}

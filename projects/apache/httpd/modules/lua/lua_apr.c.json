{"module":"lua_apr.c","summary":"This module provides Lua bindings for Apache's apr_table data structure, allowing Lua scripts to get and set values in Apache request tables. It implements metatable functionality to handle table operations and includes validation to prevent newlines in table values.","logs":[{"function":"lua_table_set","message_template":"mod_lua: Value for '%s' in table '%s' contains newline!","reason":"Warns when a value containing newlines is being set in a table that's not the 'notes' table. This likely occurs when Lua code is trying to store multi-line content in a header or other table that shouldn't contain newlines.","resolution":"Review your Lua code and ensure you're not trying to set multi-line values in Apache tables. If multi-line content is needed, consider encoding it (e.g., base64) or storing it in the 'notes' table which allows newlines. The system will automatically replace newlines with spaces but this may cause unexpected behavior."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

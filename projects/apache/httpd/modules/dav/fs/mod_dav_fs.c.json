{"module":"mod_dav_fs.c","summary":"This module implements filesystem-based WebDAV functionality for Apache HTTP Server, providing lock database management and quota controls for WebDAV resources. It handles mutex creation, quota configuration, and database path verification.","logs":[{"function":"dav_fs_get_quota","message_template":"quota configuration subrequest failed","reason":"This error occurs when a subrequest to determine quota configuration fails. Likely due to server configuration issues or resource limitations when attempting to process a WebDAV request.","resolution":"Check the Apache server configuration for WebDAV directories and ensure proper permissions. Verify that the directory structure is accessible and correctly configured in the Apache configuration files."},{"function":"dav_fs_get_quota","message_template":"quota configuration tree walk failed","reason":"This error occurs when the directory tree walk fails during quota configuration. This might happen due to filesystem permission issues or incorrect directory structure.","resolution":"Verify filesystem permissions for the WebDAV directories. Ensure that the Apache process has sufficient access rights to traverse the directory structure. Check for any corrupted directories or symlinks."},{"function":"dav_fs_child_init","message_template":"child init failed for mutex","reason":"The initialization of the global mutex in a child process failed. This could be due to resource limitations or permission issues when trying to access the mutex file.","resolution":"Check the permissions of the Apache runtime directory where mutex files are stored. Ensure that the Apache process has write access to this directory. Verify that the system has sufficient resources for mutex creation."},{"function":"dav_fs_post_config","message_template":"could not create lock mutex","reason":"The server failed to create the global mutex needed for the DAV lock database. This could be due to system resource limitations or permission issues.","resolution":"Check system resource limits and Apache runtime directory permissions. Ensure that the mutex mechanism selected in Apache configuration is supported by your operating system. Consider changing the mutex type using the Mutex directive."},{"function":"dav_fs_cmd_davlockdb","message_template":"Invalid DAVLockDB path %s","reason":"An invalid path was specified for the DAVLockDB directive in the server configuration. The path could not be resolved relative to the server root.","resolution":"Correct the path specified in the DAVLockDB directive. Ensure the path is valid and accessible to the Apache server process. The path should either be absolute or correctly specified relative to the ServerRoot directive."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

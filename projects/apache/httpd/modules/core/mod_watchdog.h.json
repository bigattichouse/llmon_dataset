{"module":"mod_watchdog.h","summary":"This header file defines the interface for Apache's watchdog module, which provides functionality to monitor the health of Apache processes and execute callback functions at specified intervals. It includes constants, function declarations, and hooks for creating, registering, and managing watchdog instances.","logs":[{"function":"ap_watchdog_get_instance","message_template":"Error getting watchdog instance: %s","reason":"This function would likely log an error when it fails to create or retrieve a watchdog instance. This could happen due to memory allocation failures or if an invalid name is provided.","resolution":"Check system resources and ensure valid watchdog names are used. Verify that Apache was built with watchdog support."},{"function":"ap_watchdog_register_callback","message_template":"Registered callback for watchdog %s with interval %d ms","reason":"This would log successful registration of a callback function with a watchdog instance. Informational message to track watchdog configuration.","resolution":"Information log, no resolution required"},{"function":"ap_watchdog_register_callback","message_template":"Failed to register callback: %s","reason":"This would log when callback registration fails, possibly due to the same callback already being registered (APR_EEXIST) or memory issues.","resolution":"Ensure callbacks are only registered once and check system resources if issues persist."},{"function":"ap_watchdog_set_callback_interval","message_template":"Updated callback interval for watchdog %s to %d ms","reason":"Logs when a callback's interval is successfully updated. Informational message for tracking configuration changes.","resolution":"Information log, no resolution required"},{"function":"ap_watchdog_set_callback_interval","message_template":"Failed to update callback interval: %s","reason":"Logs when updating a callback interval fails, possibly because the callback wasn't found (APR_EOF).","resolution":"Ensure the callback was previously registered before attempting to update its interval."},{"function":"watchdog_need","message_template":"Watchdog %s required by module","reason":"This hook would log when a module indicates it needs notifications from a specific watchdog instance.","resolution":"Information log, no resolution required"},{"function":"watchdog_init","message_template":"Initializing watchdog %s","reason":"This hook would log when a watchdog thread is being initialized, indicating the start of monitoring.","resolution":"Information log, no resolution required"},{"function":"watchdog_exit","message_template":"Terminating watchdog %s","reason":"This hook would log when a watchdog thread is being terminated, indicating the end of monitoring.","resolution":"Information log, no resolution required"},{"function":"watchdog_step","message_template":"Watchdog %s step processing","reason":"This hook would log periodic updates about the watchdog's execution. This is likely verbose logging for debugging.","resolution":"Information log, no resolution required except during debugging when it can provide insight into watchdog activity."},{"function":"ap_watchdog_callback_fn_t","message_template":"Watchdog callback executing with state: %d","reason":"This would log when a registered callback function is executed by the watchdog with a specific state (starting, running, or stopping).","resolution":"Information log, no resolution required unless errors are occurring during callback execution."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

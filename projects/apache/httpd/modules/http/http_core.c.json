{"module":"http.c","summary":"This module implements the core HTTP protocol handling in Apache, managing HTTP connections, processing requests, and setting up the filter chain for request and response processing. It handles persistent connections (keep-alive), chunked encoding, and other HTTP protocol features.","logs":[{"function":"set_keep_alive_timeout","message_template":"KeepAliveTimeout has wrong format","reason":"Logs an error when the KeepAliveTimeout configuration directive has an invalid format. This occurs when parsing the timeout value specified in the Apache configuration.","resolution":"Check the KeepAliveTimeout directive in your Apache configuration files. The value should be a number followed by an optional 's' for seconds (e.g., '15' or '15s')."},{"function":"h1_post_read_request","message_template":"client sent unknown Transfer-Encoding (%s): %s","reason":"Logs when a client sends a request with an unsupported or malformed Transfer-Encoding header. This is a protocol violation that requires the server to reject the request.","resolution":"This may indicate a client misbehavior or potential attack. Check the client application sending the request. If frequent occurrences are seen from legitimate clients, they may need to be updated to comply with HTTP standards."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

{"module":"mod_bucketeer.c","summary":"An Apache module that splits buckets when specific control characters are found in text content. It processes only text content types, skipping others, and handles bucket operations based on three configurable delimiter characters for bucket boundaries, passing brigades, and flushing.","logs":[{"function":"bucketeer_out_filter","message_template":"Removing bucketeer filter for non-text content","reason":"The filter is designed to work only with content types starting with 'text\/'. When a non-text content type is detected, the filter removes itself.","resolution":"This is an informational message. No resolution required unless you specifically want this filter to process a non-text content type, in which case you would need to modify the module code."},{"function":"bucketeer_out_filter","message_template":"Removed Content-Length header for bucketeer processing","reason":"The filter removes the Content-Length header because it may modify the content length through bucket manipulation.","resolution":"This is normal behavior as the filter can change content length. No resolution needed unless it causes issues with clients expecting accurate Content-Length headers."},{"function":"bucketeer_out_filter","message_template":"BUCKETEER filter processed EOS bucket","reason":"The filter has finished processing and encountered an End-of-Stream bucket, signaling the end of the content.","resolution":"Informational log, no resolution required."},{"function":"bucketeer_out_filter","message_template":"BUCKETEER filter ignoring FLUSH bucket","reason":"The filter explicitly ignores FLUSH buckets as noted in the code comment 'we decide what to stream'.","resolution":"Informational log, no resolution required unless you need flush buckets to be processed immediately."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

{"module":"mod_env.c","summary":"The env_module in Apache HTTP Server manages environment variables for CGI scripts through configuration directives PassEnv, SetEnv, and UnsetEnv. It allows passing existing environment variables, setting new variables with values, and removing variables from the CGI environment.","logs":[{"function":"add_env_module_vars_passed","message_template":"PassEnv variable %s was undefined","reason":"Logs a warning when the PassEnv directive refers to an environment variable that doesn't exist in the server's environment. Likely occurs when configuration references variables that haven't been set in the server startup environment.","resolution":"Ensure the environment variable is defined in the server's environment before Apache starts, possibly by setting it in the startup script or system environment. Alternatively, use SetEnv instead of PassEnv to explicitly define the value."},{"function":"add_env_module_vars_set","message_template":"Spurious usage of '=' in an environment variable name. '%s %s %s' expected instead?","reason":"Logs a warning when a SetEnv directive contains an equals sign in the variable name part, indicating improper syntax. Likely occurs when users try to use 'SetEnv FOO=BAR' syntax instead of the correct 'SetEnv FOO BAR'.","resolution":"Modify the SetEnv directive to use the proper syntax with space separation between the variable name and value, e.g., 'SetEnv FOO BAR' instead of 'SetEnv FOO=BAR'. The module suggests the correct syntax in the warning message."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

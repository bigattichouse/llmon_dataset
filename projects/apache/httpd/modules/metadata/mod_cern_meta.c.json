{"module":"mod_cern_meta.c","summary":"The mod_cern_meta module emulates CERN HTTPD Meta file semantics, allowing additional HTTP headers to be specified for files. It provides configuration directives to enable\/disable meta files, specify meta file directories, and define the suffix for meta files.","logs":[{"function":"scan_meta_file","message_template":"malformed header in meta file: %s","reason":"Logs an error when a meta file contains a header without a colon separator. This indicates a syntactical error in the meta file structure.","resolution":"Examine the specified meta file and ensure all headers are properly formatted with a name, colon, and value. Each meta file entry should follow the HTTP header format 'Header-Name: value'."},{"function":"add_cern_meta_data","message_template":"internal error in mod_cern_meta: %s","reason":"Logs an error when the module fails to correctly parse the file path structure. This typically occurs when the module cannot identify the directory components in the file path.","resolution":"Check the file path structure and ensure it follows expected patterns. This could indicate an issue with Apache's internal file path handling or an unexpected directory structure."},{"function":"add_cern_meta_data","message_template":"meta file permissions deny server access: %s","reason":"Logs an error when the web server doesn't have sufficient permissions to access the meta file. This prevents the module from reading the additional headers.","resolution":"Check and adjust file permissions for the meta file and its parent directories. Ensure the Apache process has read access to the meta files while maintaining appropriate security restrictions."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

{"module":"mod_buffer.c","summary":"The mod_buffer module improves performance in Apache by buffering the input and output filter stacks, collapsing many small buckets into fewer large buckets. It provides configuration options to control buffer size and handles both input and output filtering to optimize data transfer.","logs":[{"function":"set_buffer_size","message_template":"BufferSize must be a size in bytes, and greater than zero","reason":"This error occurs when the 'BufferSize' directive is configured with an invalid value. The value must be a positive number representing bytes.","resolution":"Check the configuration and ensure that the BufferSize directive is set to a positive integer value. The default size is 128KB (131072 bytes) if unspecified."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

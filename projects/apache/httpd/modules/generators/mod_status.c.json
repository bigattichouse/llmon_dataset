The status module requires a scoreboard to function properly.","resolution":"This error indicates that the server-status page cannot be displayed because Apache is running in inetd mode, which doesn't maintain a scoreboard. If you need server status information, reconfigure Apache to run in standalone mode rather than inetd mode."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

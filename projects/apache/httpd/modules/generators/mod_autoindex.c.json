{"module":"mod_autoindex.c","summary":"This Apache module handles the on-the-fly HTML directory index generation when a client requests a directory that doesn't have an index file. It supports various configuration options for customizing the appearance and behavior of the directory listings, including sorting, filtering, and styling.","logs":[{"function":"index_directory","message_template":"Can't open directory for index: %s","reason":"This error occurs when the module attempts to open a directory for indexing but fails. This is typically due to filesystem permissions issues where the web server doesn't have read access to the directory.","resolution":"Check the permissions on the directory and ensure the user running the web server has read and execute permissions on it. Also verify the directory exists and isn't a symlink pointing to an invalid location."},{"function":"handle_autoindex","message_template":"Cannot serve directory %s: No matching DirectoryIndex (%s) found, and server-generated directory index forbidden by Options directive","reason":"This occurs when a client tries to access a directory, no default index file (like index.html) exists, and the directory is configured to forbid automatic directory listings through the Options directive.","resolution":"Either create an appropriate index file in the directory, modify the DirectoryIndex directive to include existing files, or enable the Indexes option in the Apache configuration for this directory if directory listings are desired."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

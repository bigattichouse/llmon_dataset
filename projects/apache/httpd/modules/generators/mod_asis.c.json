{"module":"mod_asis.c","summary":"The mod_asis module allows for direct sending of HTTP headers and content without standard Apache processing. It handles files with the 'send-as-is' handler and is typically used for generating special HTTP responses with custom headers.","logs":[{"function":"asis_handler","message_template":"File does not exist: %s","reason":"Logs an informational message when a requested file cannot be found. Likely occurs when a client requests a non-existent file with the send-as-is handler.","resolution":"Verify the file path is correct and that the file exists in the specified location. This is typically a client-side issue rather than a server configuration problem."},{"function":"asis_handler","message_template":"file permissions deny server access: %s","reason":"Logs an error when the server cannot access a file due to insufficient permissions. This happens when Apache doesn't have read access to the requested file.","resolution":"Check and correct the file permissions to ensure the Apache process has read access to the file. This may require changing ownership with chown or permissions with chmod."},{"function":"asis_handler","message_template":"mod_asis: failed to find end-of-headers position for %s","reason":"Logs an error when the module cannot determine where the HTTP headers end in the file. This may occur if the file format is incorrect or corrupted.","resolution":"Verify the format of the send-as-is file. It should start with valid HTTP headers followed by a blank line and then the content. Check for malformed headers or missing blank line separator."},{"function":"asis_handler","message_template":"mod_asis: ap_pass_brigade failed for file %s","reason":"Logs an error when the module fails to send the file content to the output filters. This might happen due to network issues or resource constraints.","resolution":"Check server load, available memory, and network connectivity. This could be caused by server overload, configuration problems in output filters, or client disconnection during transmission."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

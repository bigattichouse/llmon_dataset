{"module":"mod_optional_fn_import.c","summary":"This module implements an interface for importing and using optional functions in Apache HTTP Server. It registers hooks for log transaction processing and function retrieval, allowing other modules to provide implementations of the TestOptionalFn function that can be called during request processing.","logs":[{"function":"ImportLogTransaction","message_template":"[Indirect: calls external function with r->the_request]","reason":"This function is called during the log transaction phase of request processing and delegated to an external function if available. The external function may generate logs based on the request string.","resolution":"If issues occur with this module, verify that the TestOptionalFn function is properly implemented and registered by another module. No direct resolution is needed for this module itself as it only acts as a connector."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

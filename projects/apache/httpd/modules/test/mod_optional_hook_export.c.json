{"module":"mod_optional_hook_export.c","summary":"This Apache module implements and exports an optional hook mechanism that allows other modules to process HTTP request data during the logging phase. It provides infrastructure for extending Apache's functionality through the hook system rather than directly performing logging itself.","logs":[{"function":"ExportLogTransaction","message_template":"r->the_request (HTTP request line)","reason":"Passes the client's original HTTP request line to optional hooks during the log transaction phase. This allows other modules to process or log the request information.","resolution":"This is part of the normal hook processing system, not an error condition. If unexpected logging behavior occurs, check which modules have registered with the optional_hook_test hook."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

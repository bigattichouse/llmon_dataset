{"module":"mod_dialup.c","summary":"The mod_dialup Apache module simulates different modem speeds by limiting data transfer rates. It works by sending data in controlled pulses with configurable byte-per-second rates based on standard modem speeds like V.21, V.32, etc. The module handles HTTP GET requests and supports request suspension functionality.","logs":[{"function":"dialup_send_pulse","message_template":"dialup: pulse: ap_pass_brigade failed:","reason":"The module failed to pass data to the output filter chain after preparing a packet of data to send. This likely occurs due to network issues or when the connection is broken unexpectedly.","resolution":"Check the client connection status and network stability. This error might require investigation of network infrastructure if it occurs frequently."},{"function":"dialup_callback","message_template":"dialup: pulse returned: %d","reason":"The pulse operation returned an unexpected status code (not SUSPENDED or DONE), indicating a failure in the data transmission process.","resolution":"The status code in the message provides additional information about the specific failure. Common issues might involve network problems, memory allocation failures, or connection issues."},{"function":"dialup_handler","message_template":"dialup: MPM doesn't support suspending","reason":"The current Multi-Processing Module (MPM) in Apache doesn't support the suspend\/resume functionality required by mod_dialup for simulating slower connection speeds.","resolution":"Switch to an MPM that supports suspending, such as worker or event MPM. This is a configuration issue rather than a runtime error."},{"function":"dialup_handler","message_template":"dialup: declined, meets conditions, good luck core handler","reason":"The request met conditions for conditional requests (like If-Modified-Since), so mod_dialup is declining to handle it and letting the core handler process it instead.","resolution":"This is an informational message rather than an error. If you want mod_dialup to handle these requests anyway, you might need to modify the module code."},{"function":"dialup_handler","message_template":"dialup: failed, send pulse","reason":"The initial attempt to send a pulse of data failed with a status that wasn't SUSPENDED or DONE, indicating a problem with the data transfer mechanism.","resolution":"Check server resources, client connection status, and look for related errors in the logs. The issue might be related to file access problems or memory constraints."},{"function":"cmd_modem_standard","message_template":"mod_dialup: Unknown Modem Standard specified.","reason":"The ModemStandard directive in the configuration specified an unknown or unsupported modem type. Only V.21, V.26bis, V.32, V.34, V.92, and i-was-rich-and-got-a-leased-line are supported.","resolution":"Check the configuration and ensure that the ModemStandard directive uses one of the supported values. This is a configuration error that occurs during server startup or configuration reload."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

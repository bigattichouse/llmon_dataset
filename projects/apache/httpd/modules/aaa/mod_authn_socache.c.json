{"module":"mod_authn_socache.c","summary":"Apache module that provides caching functionality for authentication credentials. It improves performance by storing credentials in a shared object cache to avoid repeated authentication checks, using mutexes for thread safety across processes.","logs":[{"function":"authn_cache_precfg","message_template":"failed to register %s mutex","reason":"The module couldn't register a mutex with the Apache Portable Runtime (APR). This is a critical initialization error that occurs during pre-configuration.","resolution":"Check system resources and permissions. The server might be low on resources or have reached a system limit for mutex objects."},{"function":"authn_cache_post_config","message_template":"Please select a socache provider with AuthnCacheSOCache (no default found on this platform). Maybe you need to load mod_socache_shmcb or another socache module first","reason":"No socache provider was configured or available, which is required for the module to function properly.","resolution":"Add 'AuthnCacheSOCache' directive to the configuration and ensure that an appropriate socache module (like mod_socache_shmcb) is loaded before this module."},{"function":"authn_cache_post_config","message_template":"failed to create mod_socache_shmcb socache instance: %s","reason":"The module failed to create a socache instance using the default provider (mod_socache_shmcb).","resolution":"Check the error message for specific details.

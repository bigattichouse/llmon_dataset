{"module":"h2_stream.h","summary":"This header file defines the interface for HTTP\/2 streams in Apache's mod_h2 module, managing the lifecycle of HTTP\/2 streams including state transitions, data handling, and error processing. It provides the foundation for request and response handling in the HTTP\/2 protocol implementation.","logs":[{"function":"Multiple functions","message_template":"h2_stream(%d-%lu-%d,%s): ","reason":"This is a format string used by H2_STRM_MSG and H2_STRM_LOG macros to prefix log messages with stream identification details including child number, session ID, stream ID, and stream state.","resolution":"This is an informational template used throughout the module. No resolution required as it's just a formatting pattern."},{"function":"Debug assertions","message_template":"Assertion failed: (s)->magic == m","reason":"In debug builds, this assertion checks that stream objects have the correct magic number, which helps detect memory corruption or use-after-free issues.","resolution":"If this assertion fails, it indicates a serious memory corruption issue or programming error. Check for buffer overflows, use-after-free, or incorrect memory management in the code that handles h2_stream objects."},{"function":"h2_stream_rst","message_template":"Stream reset with error code","reason":"Indicates that a stream was reset with a specific HTTP\/2 error code, which can happen due to protocol errors, timeouts, or client-initiated resets.","resolution":"Check the error code to understand the specific reason for the reset. Common issues include stream timeouts, protocol violations, or client connection problems. May require adjusting timeout settings or fixing protocol handling bugs."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

{"module":"proxy_balancer_rr_module.c","summary":"An Apache module implementing a simple round-robin load balancing method for the Apache proxy. It cycles through available worker nodes in sequence, skipping unavailable workers and handling standby configurations. This is designed as an example implementation.","logs":[{"function":"find_best_roundrobin","message_template":"proxy: Entering roundrobin for BALANCER %s (%d)","reason":"Debug log message indicating the round-robin load balancer function has been called for a specific balancer. The message includes the balancer name and process ID for troubleshooting.","resolution":"This is an informational debug message. No resolution is required. It's useful for tracing the execution flow when debugging load balancing issues."},{"function":"find_best_roundrobin","message_template":"proxy: Creating roundrobin ctx for BALANCER %s (%d)","reason":"Debug log message indicating a new round-robin context is being created for a balancer. This happens when a balancer is used for the first time in this process.","resolution":"This is an informational debug message. No resolution is required. If you see this message repeatedly for the same balancer, it might indicate that the balancer context is not being properly maintained across requests."},{"function":"find_best_roundrobin","message_template":"proxy: roundrobin index: %d (%d)","reason":"Debug log message showing the current index in the round-robin worker selection sequence. It helps track which worker node will be considered next in the selection process.","resolution":"This is an informational debug message. No resolution is required. If you notice the index isn't incrementing properly, it could indicate an issue with the round-robin algorithm implementation."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

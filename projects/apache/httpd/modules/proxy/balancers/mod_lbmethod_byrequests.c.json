{"module":"mod_lbmethod_byrequests.c","summary":"This module implements the 'byrequests' load balancing method for Apache's mod_proxy. It distributes requests to backend servers based on their assigned work quotas (lbfactor), selecting workers that most urgently need to fulfill their quota (highest lbstatus).","logs":[{"function":"lbmethod_byrequests_post_config","message_template":"mod_proxy must be loaded for mod_lbmethod_byrequests","reason":"This error occurs when the module detects that mod_proxy is not loaded. Since this module depends on mod_proxy to function, it cannot initialize properly without it.","resolution":"Ensure that mod_proxy is loaded in the Apache configuration before this module. Add 'LoadModule proxy_module modules\/mod_proxy.so' to your httpd.conf if it's not already present."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

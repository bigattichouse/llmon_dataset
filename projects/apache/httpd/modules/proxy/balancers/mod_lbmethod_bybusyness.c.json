{"module":"mod_lbmethod_bybusyness.c","summary":"This Apache module implements a load balancing method that selects backend servers based on their 'busyness' (number of active connections). It provides a 'bybusyness' algorithm that favors less busy workers, with tie-breaking based on load balancer status counters.","logs":[{"function":"lbmethod_bybusyness_post_config","message_template":"mod_proxy must be loaded for mod_lbmethod_bybusyness","reason":"The module detected that mod_proxy is not loaded, which is a required dependency. This happens when the bybusyness load balancing method is configured but the core proxy module is missing.","resolution":"Ensure that mod_proxy is loaded in your Apache configuration before this module. Add 'LoadModule proxy_module modules\/mod_proxy.so' to your httpd.conf file or ensure it's not commented out."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

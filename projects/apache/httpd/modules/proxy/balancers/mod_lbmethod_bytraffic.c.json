{"module":"mod_lbmethod_bytraffic.c","summary":"This module implements a load balancing method for Apache's mod_proxy based on traffic (bytes transferred). It distributes requests among backend servers proportionally to their assigned weights, considering the actual network traffic handled by each worker to ensure even distribution according to capacity.","logs":[{"function":"lbmethod_bytraffic_post_config","message_template":"mod_proxy must be loaded for mod_lbmethod_bytraffic","reason":"This error occurs when the module tries to retrieve a function pointer from mod_proxy but fails, indicating that mod_proxy isn't loaded. The bytraffic load balancing method depends on mod_proxy to function properly.","resolution":"Ensure that mod_proxy is loaded before mod_lbmethod_bytraffic in your Apache configuration. Add 'LoadModule proxy_module modules\/mod_proxy.so' before loading this module. This is a configuration error that prevents the server from starting."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

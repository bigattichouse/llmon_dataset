{"module":"mod_log_json.c","summary":"This module provides JSON-formatted logging for Apache HTTP Server. It serializes various request attributes into a structured JSON format, including request details, client information, and TLS data when available. The module registers a log handler with the format specifier '^JS'.","logs":[{"function":"log_json","message_template":"json_dump_callback failed: %d","reason":"Logs an error when the JSON serialization process fails. This occurs when the request data cannot be properly converted to JSON format. Likely due to memory issues or data that cannot be properly encoded.","resolution":"Check system memory resources and review the request data for unusual characters or structures that might be causing serialization problems. May require increasing memory limits or updating the jansson library."},{"function":"log_json","message_template":"apr_brigade_pflatten failed","reason":"Logs an error when the module fails to flatten the bucket brigade containing the serialized JSON data. This typically happens due to memory allocation failures or other I\/O problems.","resolution":"Verify system resources, particularly memory availability. Check for any issues with the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) library. May require reconfiguring memory limits or investigating system-level I\/O problems."},{"function":"log_json","message_template":"{\"mod_log_json_error\": \"critical error during serialization: see error log\"}","reason":"Returns a fallback JSON error message when either json_dump_callback or apr_brigade_pflatten fails. This message is sent to the client or log consumer in place of the actual JSON log data.","resolution":"Consult the Apache error log for the specific failure details. The resolution depends on the underlying error as indicated in the error log (either json_dump_callback or apr_brigade_pflatten failure)."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

{"module":"ssl_engine_mutex.c","summary":"This module manages mutex operations for SSL session cache in Apache's mod_ssl. It provides functions to initialize, reinitialize, acquire, and release mutexes to ensure thread-safe access to the SSL session cache when the cache provider is not internally thread-safe.","logs":[{"function":"ssl_mutex_reinit","message_template":"Cannot reinit %s mutex with file `%s'","reason":"Logs an error when reinitializing the mutex fails due to issues with the lock file. This typically occurs during Apache child process initialization when attempting to access the mutex file.","resolution":"Check file permissions and paths for the lock file. Ensure that the Apache process has appropriate permissions to access the mutex file. The issue might be resolved by manually removing the lock file if it has become corrupted."},{"function":"ssl_mutex_reinit","message_template":"Cannot reinit %s mutex","reason":"Logs a warning when reinitializing the mutex fails without a specific lock file. This typically occurs during Apache child process initialization.","resolution":"Check the mutex configuration and Apache process permissions. This may be resolved by restarting Apache or checking for system-level locking issues."},{"function":"ssl_mutex_on","message_template":"Failed to acquire SSL session cache lock","reason":"Logs a warning when the process fails to acquire the mutex lock for the SSL session cache. This can happen when there are contention issues or if the mutex mechanism is damaged.","resolution":"Check for deadlocks or high contention in the SSL session cache. May be resolved by reducing server load, increasing timeout values, or restarting Apache. In persistent cases, consider using a different session cache provider."},{"function":"ssl_mutex_off","message_template":"Failed to release SSL session cache lock","reason":"Logs a warning when the process fails to release the mutex lock for the SSL session cache. This indicates a potential deadlock or system resource issue.","resolution":"This is a critical issue that could lead to SSL session cache deadlocks. Restart Apache to clear all mutex locks. If the issue persists, investigate system-level locking mechanisms or consider using a different session cache provider that doesn't require external locking."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

{"module":"ssl_engine_rand.c","summary":"This module handles the seeding of OpenSSL's Pseudorandom Number Generator (PRNG) with entropy from various sources including files, external programs, EGD, and built-in sources like system time and process ID. It's a critical component for ensuring secure SSL\/TLS connections in Apache's mod_ssl.","logs":[{"function":"ssl_rand_seed","message_template":"%sSeeding PRNG with %d bytes of entropy","reason":"Logs information about the amount of entropy (in bytes) that was successfully used to seed the PRNG. This is important for cryptographic security as insufficient entropy can lead to predictable 'random' numbers.","resolution":"This is an informational message (TRACE2 level) indicating normal operation. If the entropy amount is consistently very low, consider adding more entropy sources in the SSL configuration to improve cryptographic strength."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

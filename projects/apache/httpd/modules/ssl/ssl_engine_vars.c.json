{"module":"ssl_engine_vars.c","summary":"Implements variable lookup functionality for mod_ssl, providing access to SSL\/TLS-related information such as certificate details, cipher information, and connection parameters. This module enables Apache to expose SSL variables to configuration directives, logging, and scripting contexts.","logs":[{"function":"ssl_ext_list","message_template":"could not parse OID '%s'","reason":"Logs when the module fails to parse an Object Identifier (OID) string provided as an extension name. This occurs when an invalid or unrecognized OID format is used when trying to extract certificate extensions.","resolution":"Ensure the certificate extension OID is properly formatted. This could be caused by a typo in a configuration that references a specific certificate extension. Check the format of the extension identifier, which should be in the form of a long name, short name, or numeric OID."},{"function":"ssl_ext_list","message_template":"Found an extension '%s', but failed to create a string from it","reason":"Logs when the module finds a requested certificate extension but fails to convert its value to a string representation. This typically happens with complex extension types that aren't supported by the X509V3_EXT_print function.","resolution":"This is typically an issue with the structure of the certificate extension rather than a configuration problem. The extension exists but is in a format that cannot be easily represented as a string. If this information is critical, you may need to use OpenSSL command-line tools to examine the certificate in more detail."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

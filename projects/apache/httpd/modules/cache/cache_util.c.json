{"module":"mod_cache.c","summary":"The mod_cache module handles caching functionality in Apache HTTP Server, managing cache entries for HTTP requests, controlling cache freshness, and implementing cache locking to prevent thundering herd problems when stale content needs revalidation.","logs":[{"function":"cache_try_lock","message_template":"Could not create a cache lock directory: %s","reason":"This error occurs when the module fails to create a directory needed for cache locking functionality. This is likely due to file permission issues or disk space problems.","resolution":"Check file permissions for the cache directory and ensure the Apache process has write access. Also verify there is sufficient disk space available."},{"function":"cache_try_lock","message_template":"Could not stat a cache lock file: %s","reason":"This error occurs when the module fails to get information about an existing cache lock file.

Verify the file system is working correctly."},{"function":"cache_try_lock","message_template":"Cache lock file for '%s' too old, removing: %s","reason":"A cache lock file has been detected as too old (exceeding configured max age) and will be removed. This can happen if a previous request failed to complete or clean up properly.","resolution":"This is automated recovery behavior.

{"module":"mod_cache.h","summary":"Main header file for Apache's Transparent Cache module that defines the API, data structures, and hooks for cache handling. It provides the foundation for caching HTTP responses and defines the cache provider interface that concrete cache implementations must support.","logs":[{"function":"cache_status hook","message_template":"cache-hit","reason":"Indicates that the requested content was found in the cache and served directly without going to the backend server. This is logged when a cache hit occurs.","resolution":"Informational log, no resolution required. This is a positive indication that the cache is working as expected."},{"function":"cache_status hook","message_template":"cache-revalidate","reason":"Indicates that the cached content was revalidated with the origin server before being served. This happens when the cached content might be stale and needs verification.","resolution":"Informational log, no resolution required. If revalidation occurs frequently, consider adjusting cache expiration settings for better performance."},{"function":"cache_status hook","message_template":"cache-miss","reason":"Indicates that the requested content was not found in the cache and had to be retrieved from the backend server. This occurs when content is requested for the first time or has expired.","resolution":"Informational log, no resolution required. If cache misses are too frequent, consider adjusting cache size, expiration policies, or investigating if cache is being properly populated."},{"function":"cache_status hook","message_template":"cache-invalidate","reason":"Indicates that cached content was explicitly invalidated, typically due to a non-GET request that would modify the resource. This ensures stale content isn't served after modifications.","resolution":"Informational log, no resolution required. Frequent invalidations might indicate inefficient cache usage patterns that could be optimized."},{"function":"cache_status hook","message_template":"cache-status","reason":"Provides general information about the cache status for a request. This might include additional details beyond the simple hit\/miss categorization.","resolution":"Informational log that provides details about cache operations. If unexpected status values appear, check cache configuration and backend server responsiveness."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

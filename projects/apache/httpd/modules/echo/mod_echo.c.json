{"module":"echo_module.c","summary":"This Apache module implements a simple echo server that reads lines from a client connection and immediately writes them back. It acts as a protocol handler that can be enabled via the ProtocolEcho directive in server configuration.","logs":[{"function":"process_echo_connection","message_template":"ProtocolEcho: Failure reading from %s","reason":"Logs an informational message when the server fails to read data from the client. This occurs when there's a connection problem that isn't an EOF (end of file) or timeout condition.","resolution":"Check network connectivity between the client and server. Verify that the client application is functioning properly. Look for potential firewall or proxy issues that might be interrupting the connection."},{"function":"process_echo_connection","message_template":"ProtocolEcho: Error - read empty brigade from %s!","message_id":"01612","reason":"Logs an informational message when the server receives an unexpected empty brigade from the client without signaling EOF or timeout. This indicates a potential issue with the input filter chain.","resolution":"Investigate if there are other Apache modules or input filters that might be interfering with the data stream. Check if the client is sending malformed requests that confuse the input filters."},{"function":"process_echo_connection","message_template":"ProtocolEcho: Failure writing to %s","message_id":"01613","reason":"Logs an informational message when the server fails to write data back to the client. This occurs when there's a problem with the output connection.","resolution":"Check if the client has closed the connection prematurely. Verify network stability and bandwidth availability. Ensure the client is properly handling the echo responses."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

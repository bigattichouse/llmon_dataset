{"module":"mod_md_md_result.h","summary":"This header file defines the result management infrastructure for Apache's mod_md module, which likely handles TLS\/SSL certificate management. It provides structures and functions for tracking operation status, reporting problems, and logging results during certificate management operations.","logs":[{"function":"md_result_log","message_template":"Varies based on result content","reason":"Logs the current state of a result object at the specified log level, potentially including status, problem, and detail information about certificate management operations.","resolution":"Resolution depends on the specific problem reported. Examine the logged details to troubleshoot certificate management issues."},{"function":"md_result_printf","message_template":"Specified by fmt parameter","reason":"Sets a formatted message in the result object which may later be logged, typically describing operation outcomes or errors during certificate management.","resolution":"Check the message details to understand what operation failed and why. May require configuration changes or fixing certificate-related issues."},{"function":"md_result_problem_printf","message_template":"Specified by fmt parameter","reason":"Sets a formatted problem description in the result object which may later be logged, providing details about certificate management errors.","resolution":"Examine the specific problem details to determine what went wrong with certificate management. Could require checking certificate validity, DNS configuration, or server permissions."},{"function":"md_result_activity_printf","message_template":"Specified by fmt parameter","reason":"Sets a formatted activity description in the result object which may later be logged, describing what certificate operation is currently being performed.","resolution":"Informational log, no resolution required. Provides insight into the current certificate management activities."},{"function":"md_result_raise","message_template":"Event specified by event parameter","reason":"Raises an event in the context of a result, which may trigger callback functions that log information about certificate management events.","resolution":"The resolution depends on the specific event raised. Check the event details for troubleshooting guidance."},{"function":"md_result_holler","message_template":"Event specified by event parameter","reason":"Broadcasts an event (\"hollers\") in the context of a result, which may trigger notifications or logs about certificate management events.","resolution":"Review the event details to understand what certificate management process is being announced. Usually informational, but may require attention if related to certificate issues."},{"function":"MD_RESULT_LOG_ID","message_template":"urn:org:apache:httpd:log:[logno]","reason":"Creates a standardized identifier for log messages, allowing for consistent tracking and identification of log entries.","resolution":"Informational identifier, no resolution required. Used to categorize and reference specific log message types."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

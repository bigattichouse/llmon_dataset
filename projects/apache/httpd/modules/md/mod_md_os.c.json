{"module":"mod_md_os.c","summary":"This module provides operating system-specific functionality for the Apache mod_md module, which likely handles Let's Encrypt\/ACME certificate management. It includes functions for changing file ownership permissions and sending graceful restart signals to the parent server process.","logs":[{"function":"md_try_chown","message_template":"Can't change owner of %s","reason":"The function failed to change ownership of a file or directory. This occurs when the chown system call returns an error, which is likely due to insufficient permissions or the file not existing.","resolution":"Verify that the Apache server has the necessary permissions to modify the file. Check that the user running Apache has ownership of the parent directory. If running as a non-root user, this error might be expected and can generally be ignored."},{"function":"md_server_graceful","message_template":"sent signal to parent","reason":"Logs a trace message when the module has sent a graceful restart signal to the parent Apache process. This is informational and indicates the certificate renewal process is requesting a server reload.","resolution":"This is an informational log, no resolution required. If seen frequently, it might indicate that something is repeatedly triggering certificate renewals or reloads."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

{"module":"md_time.c","summary":"This module provides utilities for handling time-related operations in the Apache HTTP Server, including functions for time period calculations, duration formatting, and time slice manipulations. It offers tools to parse time specifications in various formats, calculate time intervals, and generate human-readable time representations.","logs":[{"function":"md_timeslice_parse","message_template":"cannot parse NULL value","reason":"Returned when the input value to be parsed is NULL. This indicates that the caller provided an invalid (NULL) input parameter.","resolution":"Ensure that a valid string value is always provided to the function. Check for NULL pointers before calling md_timeslice_parse."},{"function":"md_timeslice_parse","message_template":"percent must be less than 100","reason":"Returned when percentage parsing fails with APR_BADARG, indicating that a negative percentage was provided.","resolution":"Ensure that percentage values are within the valid range (0-100).

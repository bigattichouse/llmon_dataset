{"module":"netware_module.c","summary":"NetWare module for Apache HTTP Server that handles CGI execution in NetWare environments. It maps file extensions to CGI handlers, configures execution environments, and provides mechanisms to launch CGI programs with appropriate parameters.","logs":[{"function":"ap_cgi_build_command","message_template":"Could not find a command associated with the %s extension","reason":"This error occurs when the module can't find a registered handler for a file extension that a user is trying to execute as CGI. Likely due to a misconfiguration in the server where the extension isn't properly mapped to a handler.","resolution":"Add a CGIMapExtension directive in the server configuration to map the extension to an appropriate handler. For example: 'CGIMapExtension \/path\/to\/handler.nlm ext' or 'CGIMapExtension OS ext' if the extension should be treated as an NLM."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

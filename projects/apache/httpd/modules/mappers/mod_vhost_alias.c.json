{"module":"mod_vhost_alias.c","summary":"This module provides dynamic mass virtual hosting capabilities for Apache by creating DocumentRoot and ScriptAlias paths based on hostname or IP patterns. It allows a single server configuration to serve multiple virtual hosts without needing separate configuration blocks for each.","logs":[{"function":"vhost_alias_set","message_template":"INTERNAL ERROR: unknown command info","reason":"This error occurs when the internal command info passed to vhost_alias_set is not recognized. This indicates a programming error within Apache or the module.","resolution":"This is likely a development error rather than a configuration issue. If encountered, report it to the Apache development team as it indicates a bug in the code."},{"function":"vhost_alias_set","message_template":"format string must be an absolute path, or 'none'","reason":"This error is logged when a format string provided in configuration (for VirtualDocumentRoot, etc.) is neither an absolute path nor the special value 'none'.","resolution":"Check your Apache configuration and ensure that all VirtualDocumentRoot, VirtualScriptAlias, and related directives use absolute paths (starting with \/) or the special value 'none'."},{"function":"vhost_alias_set","message_template":"syntax error in format string","reason":"This error occurs when the format pattern contains invalid syntax for the hostname\/IP interpolation pattern (e.g., %N.M notation).","resolution":"Review your virtual host pattern strings and ensure they follow the correct syntax. Valid patterns include %N (hostname component), %N.M (substring of hostname component), %p (port) and %% (literal %). Check the Apache documentation for details on these pattern formats."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

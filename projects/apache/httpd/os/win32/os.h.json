{"module":"win32\/os.h","summary":"This header file provides Windows-specific definitions and utility functions for the Apache HTTP Server. It includes platform identification, filesystem path handling characteristics, and functions for dynamic DLL loading on Windows systems.","logs":[{"function":"exit","message_template":"exit status code","reason":"The exit function is redefined to capture the exit status code, which might be logged elsewhere in the application. This helps track why the application terminated.","resolution":"Check the exit code value to determine the cause of termination. A non-zero code typically indicates an error condition that should be investigated."},{"function":"ap_os_proc_filepath","message_template":"process file path resolution","reason":"This function attempts to determine the executable's file path on Windows, which might fail due to permission issues or path resolution problems.","resolution":"Ensure the application has appropriate permissions to access its own executable path. Check for path length limits or invalid characters in the installation directory."},{"function":"ap_load_dll_func","message_template":"DLL function loading","reason":"This function dynamically loads functions from Windows DLLs, which might fail if the required DLLs are missing or incompatible versions are present.","resolution":"Verify all required Windows DLLs are available on the system. Update Windows or redistribute the required DLLs with the application if permitted by licensing."},{"function":"Platform detection","message_template":"Win64\/Win32","reason":"The platform identification strings may appear in logs when platform-specific issues occur or for informational purposes.","resolution":"This is typically informational only, showing which platform variant of Windows the software is running on. No resolution required unless there's a platform compatibility issue."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

{"module":"win32\/util_win32.c","summary":"This module provides Windows-specific utility functions for the Apache HTTP Server, including process filepath resolution, privileged process creation, and dynamic loading of DLL functions. It serves as a platform-specific interface layer between Apache and Windows API.","logs":[{"function":"ap_os_proc_filepath","message_template":"Error getting module filename","reason":"GetModuleFileNameW\/GetModuleFileName function call failed, likely due to a system-level error or insufficient permissions.","resolution":"Check if the process has sufficient permissions and system resources. This is generally a serious error that might indicate system instability."},{"function":"ap_os_proc_filepath","message_template":"Unicode conversion error","reason":"The conversion from UCS-2 to UTF-8 for the module filename failed, possibly due to invalid characters or buffer limits.","resolution":"This might indicate a corrupted installation or file path containing unsupported characters. Consider reinstalling Apache or moving it to a path with standard ASCII characters."},{"function":"ap_os_proc_filepath","message_template":"Filename too long","reason":"The module filename exceeded the maximum allowed length after conversion to UTF-8.","resolution":"Install Apache in a directory with a shorter path. Windows has path length limitations that can cause issues when paths are too deep or long."},{"function":"ap_load_dll_func","message_template":"Failed to load DLL","reason":"LoadLibrary failed to load one of the required DLLs (kernel32, advapi32, mswsock, or ws2_32).","resolution":"Verify that the Windows system DLLs are intact and not corrupted. This might require Windows repair or ensuring all system updates are applied."},{"function":"ap_load_dll_func","message_template":"Failed to get procedure address","reason":"GetProcAddress failed to locate a required function in a loaded DLL.","resolution":"This typically indicates a version mismatch between what Apache expects and what the system provides. Ensure Windows is up to date or consider using a version of Apache compatible with your Windows version."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

{"module":"netware\/os.h","summary":"This header file defines OS-specific definitions and functionality for the NetWare platform in Apache. It includes platform identification, custom exit handling that controls screen behavior, and filesystem characteristics specific to NetWare.","logs":[{"function":"exit macro","message_template":"Screen hold on exit based on hold_screen_on_exit flag","reason":"This macro modifies the exit behavior to potentially keep the screen open based on the exit code and hold_screen_on_exit flag value, allowing users to see final messages before the application terminates.","resolution":"If the screen is being held open unexpectedly or closing too quickly, adjust the hold_screen_on_exit flag value. Negative values force screen closure, while zero or positive values control screen holding behavior based on exit code."},{"function":"Platform definition","message_template":"NETWARE","reason":"Defines the platform identifier used throughout Apache for NetWare-specific functionality and possibly in platform identification logs.","resolution":"Informational only; no resolution required. Used for internal platform identification."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

{"module":"os_bs2000.c","summary":"This module provides OS-specific functionality for the BS2000\/OSD mainframe operating system, particularly handling process forking and user identity switching. It implements specialized versions of fork and environment initialization to maintain proper user privileges in the BS2000 job environment.","logs":[{"function":"os_init_job_environment","message_template":"The debug mode of Apache should only be started by an unprivileged user!","reason":"Logs an error when Apache is started in debug mode (one_process) by a privileged user (root). This is a security concern as running the server as root in debug mode could expose vulnerabilities.","resolution":"Restart Apache in debug mode as a non-root user. Debug mode should never be run with root privileges in production environments."},{"function":"os_fork","message_template":"ufork: Possible mis-configuration for user %s - Aborting.","reason":"Logs an emergency error when the ufork() call fails with EPERM (permission denied) error. This occurs when Apache tries to switch to a specified user but cannot due to permission issues or invalid user configuration.","resolution":"Verify that the specified user exists in the system and that Apache has the necessary permissions to switch to this user. Check the user configuration in httpd.conf and ensure the user is properly defined in the BS2000 system."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

{"module":"base64.c","summary":"This module contains unit tests for Apache HTTP server's base64 decoding functionality, specifically testing the ap_pbase64decode_strict function. It verifies proper handling of valid base64 input and rejection of invalid input with appropriate error statuses.","logs":[{"function":"base64_setup","message_template":"exit(1)","reason":"The program exits if APR pool creation fails, which would happen if the system is out of memory or resources.","resolution":"Check system resources and memory availability. This is a critical failure that prevents the test suite from running."},{"function":"ap_pbase64decode_strict","message_template":"APR_EINVAL","reason":"The function returns an error status when provided with input containing non-base64 characters, which would cause errors in production code handling base64 data.","resolution":"Ensure the base64 input only contains valid characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9, +, \/) and validate input before decoding."},{"function":"ap_pbase64decode_strict","message_template":"APR_EINVAL","reason":"The function returns an error status when provided with input that has incorrect padding at the end, which would cause errors in production code handling base64 data.","resolution":"Verify that base64 input has the correct padding format - proper number of '=' characters at the end based on the length of the encoded data."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

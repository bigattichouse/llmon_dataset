{"module":"authn.c","summary":"This module contains unit tests for Apache's basic authentication functionality, specifically testing the ap_get_basic_auth_components() function. It validates the proper parsing of Basic authentication headers in various formats and error conditions.","logs":[{"function":"authn_setup","message_template":"Memory pool creation failed","reason":"The test setup couldn't allocate a memory pool, which would cause the test to exit. In production, this would indicate severe resource constraints.","resolution":"Check system memory resources and investigate potential memory leaks. May require server restart or hardware upgrades if persistent."},{"function":"authn_setup","message_template":"Request structure allocation failed","reason":"The test couldn't allocate memory for the request structure, causing an exit. This suggests memory exhaustion.","resolution":"Review memory usage, increase available memory, or optimize memory-intensive operations in the server configuration."},{"function":"authn_setup","message_template":"Headers table creation failed","reason":"The test couldn't create a table for request headers, causing an exit. This indicates memory allocation problems.","resolution":"Check server memory settings and current load. May require increasing MaxRequestWorkers or other memory-related directives."},{"function":"ap_get_basic_auth_components","message_template":"Missing Authorization header","reason":"The function was called without an Authorization header present, resulting in APR_EINVAL. This might indicate a client error or misconfiguration.","resolution":"Ensure client is sending proper Authorization headers. Check auth configuration in Apache and ensure authentication requirements are properly communicated to clients."},{"function":"ap_get_basic_auth_components","message_template":"Non-Basic authentication scheme","reason":"The function was called with a non-Basic authentication scheme (e.g., Digest), resulting in APR_EINVAL. This suggests a mismatch between client auth method and server expectations.","resolution":"Check that the correct authentication scheme is configured. If Basic auth is required, ensure clients aren't attempting to use other schemes."},{"function":"ap_get_basic_auth_components","message_template":"Malformed Basic authentication data","reason":"The function received invalid or malformed Base64 data in the Authorization header. While the function attempts to handle various edge cases, severely malformed credentials could cause issues.","resolution":"Investigate client authentication implementation. Malformed credentials could indicate client bugs, proxies modifying headers, or potential security probes."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

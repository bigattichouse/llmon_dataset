{"module":"time-sem.c","summary":"A benchmarking utility that compares the performance of different mutex implementations (FCNTL, FLOCK, SYSVSEM, PTHREAD, USLOCK) for process synchronization. It creates multiple child processes that increment a shared counter and measures the time taken, helping server developers choose the optimal serialized accept method for their architecture.","logs":[{"function":"accept_mutex_init","message_template":"opening test-lock-thing in current directory\n","reason":"Informational message when initializing mutex using FCNTL by creating a lock file","resolution":"Informational message, no resolution required unless file creation fails"},{"function":"accept_mutex_init","message_template":"Cannot open lock file: %s\n","reason":"Failed to create or open the lock file used for FCNTL or FLOCK mutex implementation","resolution":"Check file system permissions, available space, and whether the current directory is writable"},{"function":"accept_mutex_on","message_template":"fcntl lock_it","reason":"Failed to acquire an exclusive lock on the lock file using fcntl","resolution":"Check if another process holds the lock, or if there are system limits on the number of locks"},{"function":"accept_mutex_off","message_template":"fcntl unlock_it","reason":"Failed to release a lock on the lock file using fcntl","resolution":"This may indicate a serious synchronization issue.

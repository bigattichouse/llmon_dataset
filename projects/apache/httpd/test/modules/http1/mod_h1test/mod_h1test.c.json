{"module":"h1test.c","summary":"An Apache HTTP Server module that provides an echo handler which copies the request body to the response. The module supports chunked requests and preserves content types, allowing for testing of HTTP\/1.1 features like trailers.","logs":[{"function":"h1test_echo_handler","message_template":"echo_handler: processing request","reason":"Informational message logged when the echo handler starts processing a new request. This helps track the flow of request handling.","resolution":"This is an informational log, no resolution required. It indicates normal operation."},{"function":"h1test_echo_handler","message_template":"echo_handler: copying %ld bytes from request body","reason":"Logs the number of bytes being copied from the request body to the response. This tracks the progress of large request body handling.","resolution":"This is an informational log, no resolution required. If you see unusual values, it might indicate client sending unexpectedly large or small chunks."},{"function":"h1test_echo_handler","message_template":"echo_handler: passed %ld bytes from request body","reason":"Confirms that bytes were successfully passed to the output filters. This verifies that data is flowing through the system correctly.","resolution":"This is an informational log, no resolution required. If this message appears without corresponding 'copying' messages, it might indicate filter chain issues."},{"function":"h1test_echo_handler","message_template":"echo_handler: request read","reason":"Indicates that the request body has been fully read and an end-of-stream marker has been added to the output brigade.","resolution":"This is an informational log, no resolution required. It marks successful completion of the request reading phase."},{"function":"h1test_echo_handler","message_template":"echo_handler: seeing incoming trailers","reason":"Detected HTTP trailers in the incoming request. This helps troubleshoot chunked transfer encoding implementations.","resolution":"This is an informational log, no resolution required. It indicates that the client is using chunked transfer encoding with trailers."},{"function":"h1test_echo_handler","message_template":"echo_handler: seeing incoming Add-Trailer header","reason":"Detected the 'Add-Trailer' header in the incoming request, which triggers adding a specific trailer to the response.","resolution":"This is an informational log, no resolution required. It indicates the client is testing trailer functionality with the 'Add-Trailer' header."},{"function":"h1test_echo_handler","message_template":"echo_handler: request handled","reason":"Final log message indicating the request has been successfully processed. This marks the end of request processing.","resolution":"This is an informational log, no resolution required. It confirms normal completion of the handler's work."},{"function":"h1test_echo_handler","message_template":"h1test_echo_handler failed","reason":"Indicates an error occurred during request handling that wasn't related to HTTP status codes or aborted connections. Likely due to issues with the output filter chain or memory allocation.","resolution":"Check server error logs for more specific errors. Verify proper configuration of output filters and ensure sufficient system resources. This might also indicate problems with network connectivity or client behavior."},{"function":"h1test_hooks","message_template":"installing hooks and handlers","reason":"Logged during module initialization when registering the echo handler hook. This helps track module loading process.","resolution":"This is an informational log, no resolution required. If this message is missing during server startup, the module may not be properly loaded."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

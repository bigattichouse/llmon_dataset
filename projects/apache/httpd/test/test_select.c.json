{"module":"test_select.c","summary":"A simple test program that demonstrates the exponential backoff timing in a select loop. It initializes a wait time, doubles it in each iteration until it exceeds a threshold, and uses select() to implement the actual waiting.","logs":[{"function":"main","message_template":"Start\\n","reason":"Indicates the beginning of the test program execution","resolution":"Informational log, no resolution required"},{"function":"main","message_template":"%d\\n","reason":"Displays the current wait time in microseconds for each iteration of the loop","resolution":"Informational log, no resolution required"},{"function":"main","message_template":"End\\n","reason":"Indicates the successful completion of the test program","resolution":"Informational log, no resolution required"}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

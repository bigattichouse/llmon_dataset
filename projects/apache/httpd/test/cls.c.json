{"module":"cls.c","summary":"This module provides a cache listing utility that reads cache files from a specified directory, validates their format, and displays metadata including URL, version, creation date, last modification date, and expiration date in a formatted output.","logs":[{"function":"main","message_template":"Usage: cls directory\n","reason":"Displayed when the program is executed with incorrect number of arguments. The program requires exactly one argument specifying the directory containing cache files.","resolution":"Ensure the program is executed with exactly one argument specifying a valid directory path."},{"function":"main","message_template":"opendir","reason":"Error occurs when the program cannot open the specified directory. This could be due to permissions, non-existent directory, or other file system issues.","resolution":"Check that the specified directory exists and the user has sufficient permissions to read it. Also verify the path is correctly formatted."},{"function":"main","message_template":"fopen","reason":"Error occurs when the program cannot open a cache file within the directory. This could be due to permissions, file corruption, or other file system issues.","resolution":"Check file permissions and ensure the file exists and is accessible. The file might be locked by another process or there could be file system errors."},{"function":"main","message_template":"fgets","reason":"Error occurs when reading the first line of a cache file. This may indicate a truncated or corrupted cache file.","resolution":"The cache file might be corrupted or empty.

The cache file is considered invalid or corrupted.","resolution":"The cache file format is incorrect. This could be due to corruption, a file created by a different version of the application, or a non-cache file in the cache directory. Consider recreating or removing the invalid cache file."},{"function":"main","message_template":"fgets","reason":"Error occurs when reading the second line of a cache file containing the URL.

The cache file is considered invalid.","resolution":"The cache file's URL format is incorrect.

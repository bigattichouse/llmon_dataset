{"module":"test-writev.c","summary":"This utility tests whether the system's writev() implementation efficiently handles network operations by sending 300 bytes of data in three 100-byte vectors to a TCP service. It's designed to be used alongside packet sniffing to determine if data is sent as a single efficient packet or fragmented unnecessarily.","logs":[{"function":"main","message_template":"usage: test-writev a.b.c.d port#\n","reason":"Displayed when the program is invoked with incorrect command-line arguments. Likely occurs when a user provides too few or too many arguments.","resolution":"Ensure the program is invoked with exactly two arguments: an IP address and a port number."},{"function":"main","message_template":"bogus address\n","reason":"Shown when the provided IP address cannot be parsed or is invalid. Occurs when the user provides a malformed IP address.","resolution":"Check the IP address format and ensure it's a valid dotted-decimal IPv4 address (e.g., 192.168.1.1)."},{"function":"main","message_template":"socket","reason":"Error message via perror() when socket creation fails. This could happen due to resource limitations or insufficient permissions.","resolution":"Check system resources, ensure the user has appropriate permissions, or restart the system if resource exhaustion is suspected."},{"function":"main","message_template":"connect","reason":"Error message via perror() when the connection to the target server fails. This may happen due to network issues, firewall rules, or if the target server is not running.","resolution":"Verify the target server is running and accessible, check network connectivity, and ensure there are no firewall rules blocking the connection."},{"function":"main","message_template":"TCP_NODELAY","reason":"Error message via perror() when setting the TCP_NODELAY socket option fails. This is rare but could happen if the socket implementation is non-standard.","resolution":"This is typically a system-level issue. Consider updating system libraries or the kernel if this error occurs regularly."},{"function":"main","message_template":"i=%d, errno=%d\n","reason":"Informational message showing the result of the writev operation. The first value (i) shows bytes written, and errno indicates any error code if the operation failed.","resolution":"If errno is non-zero, refer to system error documentation. If i is less than 300 (the expected total bytes), there may be network issues or buffer limitations."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

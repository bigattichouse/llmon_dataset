{"module":"ap_expr.h","summary":"This module defines an Expression Parser API for Apache HTTP Server, providing structures and functions for parsing, evaluating, and extending expressions used in server configuration. It enables conditional logic and string manipulation in server directives.","logs":[{"function":"ap_expr_parse","message_template":"Error message from expression parsing","reason":"Expression syntax error or other parsing failure. This would occur when the configuration contains an invalid expression syntax.","resolution":"Check the expression syntax in the configuration file. The error message would likely point to the specific syntax issue that needs to be corrected."},{"function":"ap_expr_exec","message_template":"Error message stored in err parameter","reason":"Runtime error during expression evaluation. This could occur when the expression references undefined variables or functions.","resolution":"Verify that all variables and functions used in the expression are properly defined.

This might occur when regular expression operations fail.","resolution":"Check the regular expressions used in the configuration. Ensure they are syntactically correct and the expression logic is valid."},{"function":"ap_expr_str_exec","message_template":"Error message stored in err parameter","reason":"Runtime error during string-valued expression evaluation. This happens when string operations in the expression fail.","resolution":"Review the string operations in the expression.

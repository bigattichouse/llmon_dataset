It declares filter handles and function prototypes for HTTP\/1.1 protocol implementation but contains no actual implementations with log messages.","logs":[{"function":"ap_http_outerror_filter","message_template":"[inferred] Error handling messages when processing output buckets","reason":"This filter handles error buckets in the output stream, likely logging details about encountered errors during HTTP response generation","resolution":"Specific resolution depends on the actual error encountered. Check server configuration and related error logs for more details."},{"function":"ap_response_code_string","message_template":"[inferred] HTTP status code messages","reason":"Returns string representations of HTTP response codes that may be logged when sending responses","resolution":"This is informational. If unexpected status codes appear in logs, check client requests and server configuration for potential issues."},{"function":"ap_send_http_trace","message_template":"[inferred] TRACE request handling messages","reason":"Handles HTTP TRACE requests which might log information about the request processing","resolution":"If TRACE-related issues appear in logs, verify whether TRACE method is properly configured and secured in your server."},{"function":"ap_h1_set_keepalive","message_template":"[inferred] Keepalive status messages","reason":"Sets keepalive status for HTTP requests which might log connection persistence information","resolution":"If keepalive issues appear in logs, check client connection behavior and server keepalive configuration."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

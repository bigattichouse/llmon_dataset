{"module":"http_protocol.h","summary":"Defines interfaces and data structures for HTTP protocol handling in Apache HTTP Server, including request reading and processing, response creation, protocol negotiation, and error handling mechanisms.","logs":[{"function":"ap_send_error_response","message_template":"500 Internal Server Error","reason":"This error message is generated when the server encounters an internal error that prevents it from fulfilling the request. This is a generic error message that could be triggered by various issues in the server processing pipeline.","resolution":"Check server error logs for more specific information about what caused the error. Investigate application code, server configuration, or resource constraints that might be causing internal server errors."},{"function":"ap_bucket_error_make","message_template":"xxx Status xxx","reason":"This message template indicates a status code being formatted into an error message when creating an error bucket. The actual status code will replace the 'xxx' placeholders.","resolution":"The resolution depends on the specific status code. Check server logs for more details about what triggered this status code and address the underlying issue."},{"function":"protocol_switch","message_template":"http\/1.1","reason":"This string appears in the protocol switching functionality and would be logged when protocols are being negotiated or switched.","resolution":"This is informational and normally doesn't require resolution unless there are issues with protocol negotiation."},{"function":"protocol_switch","message_template":"Upgrade","reason":"This string is related to the HTTP Upgrade header mechanism used for protocol switching, and would be logged during protocol upgrade operations.","resolution":"This is typically informational. If protocol upgrades are failing, check client and server configuration for supported protocols."},{"function":"ap_get_basic_auth_pw","message_template":"AP_GET_BASIC_AUTH_PW_NOTE","reason":"This is a note key that might be associated with logging related to basic authentication password retrieval.","resolution":"This is likely an internal identifier rather than an actual error message. If authentication issues occur, verify client credentials and server authentication configuration."},{"function":"log_transaction","message_template":"","reason":"This hook allows modules to perform custom logging of transactions. The actual log messages would be determined by modules implementing this hook.","resolution":"This is a framework for logging rather than a specific message. Check module-specific logs if transaction logging issues occur."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

{"module":"mpm_winnt_eventlog.c","summary":"This module redirects Apache httpd's stderr output to the Windows Event Log, enabling Apache to log errors in a Windows-native way. It creates a pipe that captures stderr output, then sends those messages to the Windows Event Log service with appropriate formatting.","logs":[{"function":"service_stderr_thread","message_template":"The Apache service named %s reported the following error:\r\n>>> %s","reason":"Logs stderr output from the Apache service to the Windows Event Log. This occurs whenever the Apache service writes any error message to stderr.","resolution":"The resolution depends on the specific error message captured from stderr. Examine the full error message after '>>>' to understand the root cause and take appropriate action."},{"function":"service_stderr_thread","message_template":"Win32 error %lu reading stderr pipe stream\r\n","reason":"Logs an error when the pipe used to capture stderr output encounters a problem that isn't a normal pipe closure. This indicates a system-level issue with the stderr redirection mechanism.","resolution":"This is typically caused by a system resource problem or an unexpected termination of the Apache process. Check for system resource limitations, restart the Apache service, and consider investigating Windows system logs for related errors."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

{"module":"simple_io.c","summary":"This module handles connection processing and I\/O operations for the Simple MPM (Multi-Processing Module) in Apache HTTP Server. It manages socket operations, connection states, and processing of HTTP requests, including timeout handling and poll events.","logs":[{"function":"simple_io_timeout_cb","message_template":"io timeout hit (?)","reason":"Logs a warning when a connection timeout occurs. This typically happens when a client connection is idle for too long or taking too long to complete a transaction.","resolution":"Check network conditions, client behavior, or consider increasing timeout values in the server configuration if timeouts are occurring frequently. This could also indicate slow clients or network congestion."},{"function":"simple_io_process","message_template":"simple_io_process: apr_pollcb_remove failure","reason":"Logs an error when the server fails to remove a socket from the poll callback mechanism. This indicates a problem with the event handling infrastructure.","resolution":"This is likely a system resource issue or a bug in the event handling code. Check system limits, server load, and consider restarting the server if this error occurs frequently."},{"function":"simple_io_process","message_template":"apr_pollcb_add: failed in write completion","reason":"Logs a warning when the server fails to add a socket to the poll callback mechanism during write completion. This can disrupt the connection's ability to complete sending responses.","resolution":"Check for system resource limits like maximum file descriptors, high load on the server, or potential network issues. This could indicate the server is overwhelmed with connections."},{"function":"simple_io_process","message_template":"process_socket: apr_pollcb_add failure in read request line","reason":"Logs an error when the server fails to add a socket to the poll callback mechanism while preparing to read a request. This prevents the server from processing new requests on this connection.","resolution":"Verify system resources and server limits. This could be caused by exceeding maximum connection limits or file descriptor limits. Consider increasing system limits or reducing server load."},{"function":"simple_io_invoke","message_template":"simple_io_invoke: simple_io_process failed (?)","reason":"Logs a debug message when the connection processing fails for an unknown reason. This indicates an unexpected error in the connection handling logic.","resolution":"Check the server logs for additional error messages that might provide more context. This is often a symptom of other underlying issues in the connection processing chain."},{"function":"simple_io_setup_conn","message_template":"simple_io_setup_conn: connection aborted","reason":"Logs a debug message when a connection is aborted during setup. This typically happens when the pre-connection hooks return an error or when the client disconnects prematurely.","resolution":"This is often due to client-side issues or network problems. If happening frequently, check for misbehaving clients, network issues, or potential DoS attacks. Some legitimate aborts are normal in regular operation."},{"function":"simple_io_setup_conn","message_template":"simple_io_setup_conn: simple_io_process failed (?)","reason":"Logs a debug message when the initial processing of a new connection fails. This could indicate problems initializing the connection or handling the first request.","resolution":"Check for configuration issues, resource constraints, or bugs in request processing modules. This could be related to virtual host configuration or connection processing limits."},{"function":"simple_io_accept","message_template":"simple_io_accept: apr_socket_accept failed","reason":"Logs a critical error when the server fails to accept a new connection. This is a serious issue that prevents the server from handling new client connections.","resolution":"This could indicate the server has reached connection limits, is out of file descriptors, or has network stack issues. Check system limits, network configuration, and server load. In extreme cases, it might require a server restart."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

{"module":"simple_children.c","summary":"This module manages child processes for the Apache HTTP Server's 'simple' Multi-Processing Module (MPM). It handles spawning and terminating child processes, maintaining the desired number of worker processes, and includes mechanisms for process management in both single and multi-process modes.","logs":[{"function":"simple_spawn_child","message_template":"simple_spawn_child: Unable to fork new process","reason":"This critical error occurs when the server fails to create a new child process via fork(). Likely due to the system reaching process limits, out of memory, or other resource constraints.","resolution":"Check system resource limits (ulimit), available memory, and the maximum number of processes setting. Consider reducing the number of desired child processes or increasing system resource limits. Restarting the server might temporarily resolve the issue if it's due to a temporary resource shortage."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

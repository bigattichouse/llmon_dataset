{"module":"mpm_mpmt_os2.c","summary":"This module implements the OS\/2 Multi-Processing Module (MPM) for Apache, handling child process management, worker thread management, and connection processing. It includes mechanisms for graceful shutdown, connection queuing, and exception handling specific to the OS\/2 environment.","logs":[{"function":"ap_mpm_child_main","message_template":"unable to create shutdown semaphore, exiting","reason":"The child process failed to create an event semaphore that would be used to signal worker threads to shut down. This prevents proper thread coordination.","resolution":"Check system resources and limits. The system might be low on semaphore resources or have reached a resource limit."},{"function":"ap_mpm_child_main","message_template":"scoreboard not readable in child, exiting","reason":"The child process couldn't gain access to the scoreboard shared memory, which is necessary for tracking server status and coordinating processes.","resolution":"Verify permissions on shared memory resources and ensure the parent process correctly initialized the scoreboard. May require restarting Apache."},{"function":"ap_mpm_child_main","message_template":"accept mutex couldn't be accessed in child, exiting","reason":"The mutex used for synchronizing connection acceptance across processes is not accessible to this child process.","resolution":"Check system mutex resource limits and permissions. Restarting Apache may resolve the issue if it's due to temporary resource constraints."},{"function":"ap_mpm_child_main","message_template":"child pid not found in scoreboard, exiting","reason":"The child process couldn't find its own PID in the scoreboard, suggesting a synchronization issue between parent and child processes.","resolution":"Restart Apache. If the issue persists, check for possible Apache configuration issues or OS-specific limits that might be affecting process communication."},{"function":"ap_mpm_child_main","message_template":"unable to create work queue, exiting","reason":"The child process failed to create a queue used for distributing connection requests to worker threads.","resolution":"Check OS\/2 queue resource limits. Consider reducing the number of worker threads if the system is resource-constrained."},{"function":"ap_mpm_child_main","message_template":"apr_socket_accept","reason":"An error occurred while attempting to accept a new client connection. This could be due to network issues or resource exhaustion.","resolution":"Check network connectivity and system resources. Temporary network disruptions may resolve themselves. If persistent, consider reducing server load or increasing system resources."},{"function":"thread_exception_handler","message_template":"caught exception in worker thread, initiating child shutdown pid=%d","reason":"A critical exception (access violation or divide-by-zero) occurred in a worker thread, triggering a shutdown of the entire child process to prevent resource leaks.","resolution":"Check the error logs for additional context about what caused the exception. This might indicate a bug in a module or exhaustion of some resource. Consider disabling problematic modules if identified."},{"function":"worker_main","message_template":"unable to open work queue, exiting","reason":"A worker thread couldn't open the queue used to receive connection requests, making it unable to process connections.","resolution":"May indicate that the parent process terminated abnormally or that there are OS\/2 queue resource issues. Restart Apache if this occurs."},{"function":"server_maintenance","message_template":"unable to open work queue in maintenance thread","reason":"The maintenance thread couldn't open the queue for managing worker threads, which will affect the server's ability to adjust the number of worker threads based on load.","resolution":"Check OS\/2 queue resources. This is less critical than other errors as it affects optimization rather than core functionality, but restarting Apache is still recommended."},{"function":"set_signals","message_template":"sigaction(SIGTERM)","reason":"Failed to set up a handler for the SIGTERM signal, which is used for graceful shutdown of the server.","resolution":"This is a warning rather than a fatal error. The server will continue running but might not handle shutdown signals properly. Check system resources and consider restarting if other issues occur."},{"function":"set_signals","message_template":"sigaction(SIGHUP)","reason":"Failed to set up a handler for the SIGHUP signal, which is used for server reconfiguration.","resolution":"This is a warning that indicates the server might not properly handle reconfiguration requests. The server will continue running, but restarting Apache may be necessary if reconfiguration is needed."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

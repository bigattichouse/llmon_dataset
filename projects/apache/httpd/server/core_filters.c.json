{"module":"core_filters.c","summary":"Implements core input\/output network filters for Apache HTTP Server. Handles reading data from clients (ap_core_input_filter) and writing data back to clients (ap_core_output_filter) using bucket brigades with support for non-blocking I\/O, vector writes, and sendfile operations.","logs":[{"function":"ap_core_output_filter","message_template":"core_output_filter: writing data to the network","reason":"Logs when there's a network error writing data to the client. This occurs when the client aborts the connection prematurely, causing write operations to fail.","resolution":"This is typically a client-side issue. Check if clients are properly closing connections or if there might be network problems or timeouts causing aborted connections. For frequent occurrences, consider adjusting timeout settings or investigating network stability issues."},{"function":"writev_nonblocking","message_template":"writev_nonblocking: %\/%","reason":"Detailed debug trace comparing bytes successfully written to bytes requested during vector write operations. Useful for identifying partial writes or efficiency issues.","resolution":"This is an informational trace log for debugging. If consistently showing partial writes, it might indicate network congestion or client-side processing delays. Consider tuning buffer sizes or network parameters if this affects performance."},{"function":"sendfile_nonblocking","message_template":"sendfile_nonblocking: %\/%","reason":"Detailed debug trace comparing bytes successfully written to bytes requested during sendfile operations. Helps track efficiency of file transmission.","resolution":"This is an informational trace log for debugging. If sendfile operations consistently send fewer bytes than requested, it might indicate disk I\/O issues or network congestion. For performance issues, verify disk subsystem performance or consider the 'EnableSendfile off' directive if problems persist."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

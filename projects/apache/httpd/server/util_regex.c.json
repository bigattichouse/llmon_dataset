{"module":"rxplus.c","summary":"Implements an extended regular expression interface (rxplus) for Apache HTTP Server with Perl-like syntax support. Provides functionality for compiling, executing, and extracting matches from regular expressions with additional features like flags for case-insensitivity, multi-line mode, and global substitution.","logs":[{"function":"ap_rxplus_compile","message_template":"NULL return value","reason":"Returned when regex compilation fails or when a substitution pattern is missing its replacement string. Likely occurs with malformed regular expressions or incomplete substitution patterns.","resolution":"Check the regular expression pattern syntax. For substitution patterns (s\/pattern\/replacement\/), ensure both pattern and replacement components are present."},{"function":"ap_rxplus_exec","message_template":"0 return value","reason":"Returned when the regular expression doesn't match the input string or when substitution fails. Common when data doesn't match expected patterns.","resolution":"This might be normal operation depending on context. If matches are expected, verify the regex pattern matches the expected data format."},{"function":"ap_rxplus_exec","message_template":"NULL newpattern value","reason":"Set when ap_pregsub fails to create a substitution pattern, potentially due to memory allocation issues or invalid substitution pattern.","resolution":"Check for memory constraints or malformed replacement patterns. In production systems, monitor for memory usage if this error occurs frequently."},{"function":"ap_rxplus_match","message_template":"Negative length and NULL match","reason":"Set when the requested match index is out of range or when no previous successful match exists. Occurs when trying to access non-existent capture groups.","resolution":"Ensure that ap_rxplus_exec was called and returned success before calling ap_rxplus_match. Verify that the requested capture group index is valid for the pattern used."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

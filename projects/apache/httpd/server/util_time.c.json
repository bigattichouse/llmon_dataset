{"module":"util_time.c","summary":"A utility module for Apache HTTP Server that provides efficient time formatting and manipulation functions. It implements caching mechanisms for recent timestamps and several time formatting options for server logs and HTTP headers.","logs":[{"function":"ap_recent_ctime_ex","message_template":"APR_ENOMEM","reason":"This error occurs when the provided buffer is too small to hold the formatted time string. Likely scenario is when a caller passes an insufficient buffer length for the requested format options.","resolution":"Increase the buffer size allocated for the time string. If using the function directly, ensure the buffer is at least as large as indicated by the 'len' parameter after a failed call."},{"function":"cached_explode","message_template":"APR_SUCCESS or apr_time_exp errors","reason":"This function returns status codes from the underlying apr_time_exp functions which might indicate time conversion failures. Occurs when the system cannot properly convert the time value.","resolution":"Check system time configuration. In most cases, this is a transient error that doesn't require intervention."},{"function":"ap_force_set_tz","message_template":"TZ=UTC+0","reason":"Sets the TZ environment variable to UTC+0 if it's not already set, to improve performance. This is an optimization rather than an error condition.","resolution":"This is informational only. If unexpected timezone behavior occurs, check if this function is affecting timezone settings."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

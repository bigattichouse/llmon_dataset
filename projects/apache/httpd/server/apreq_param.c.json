{"module":"apreq_param.c","summary":"This module handles HTTP parameter operations in the Apache Request library, including creating, decoding, encoding, and managing parameters from query strings and form data. It provides functionality for parameter processing, charset detection, and handling file uploads.","logs":[{"function":"apreq_param_make","message_template":"NULL","reason":"Memory allocation failed when trying to create a new parameter. This is likely due to the system being out of memory or the parameter being too large.","resolution":"Check system memory resources and consider adding memory limits for parameter sizes. Review the MAX_LEN constant if this occurs frequently."},{"function":"apreq_param_decode","message_template":"APR_EBADARG","reason":"Parameter name length is zero, which is invalid. Parameters must have a name.","resolution":"Validate input data before passing to this function. Client may be sending malformed requests with empty parameter names."},{"function":"apreq_param_decode","message_template":"status != APR_SUCCESS","reason":"Failed to decode URL-encoded parameter value. This likely indicates malformed URL encoding in the request.","resolution":"Check for malformed requests or potential encoding attacks. Consider adding input validation at the application level."},{"function":"apreq_param_decode","message_template":"status != APR_SUCCESS","reason":"Failed to decode URL-encoded parameter name.

This could be due to malformed URL encoding or oversized parameters.","resolution":"Check client requests for encoding issues.

This is a code path that should not be reached in normal operation.","resolution":"This is likely a code logic issue rather than a runtime error. If encountered, investigate the query string parser implementation for bugs."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

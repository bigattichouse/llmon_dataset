{"module":"mpm_fdqueue.c","summary":"This module implements queue management for Apache's Multi-Processing Module, handling thread pooling and socket\/timer event dispatching. It provides functionality for creating, managing, and terminating queues, with mechanisms for thread synchronization and connection handling.","logs":[{"function":"ap_queue_info_wait_for_idler","message_template":"AP_DEBUG_ASSERT(0)","reason":"Logs an error when the mutex lock fails during wait for an idle worker, indicating a critical thread synchronization issue.","resolution":"Investigate thread deadlocks or system resource exhaustion. Check system limits for thread creation and mutex operations. May require Apache restart if persistent."},{"function":"ap_queue_info_wait_for_idler","message_template":"AP_DEBUG_ASSERT(0)","reason":"Logs an error when the condition wait operation fails, indicating thread synchronization problems preventing worker allocation.","resolution":"Check system resources and thread limits. May be related to system overload or misconfiguration of the MPM worker threads. Consider increasing resources or adjusting worker configuration."},{"function":"ap_queue_push_socket","message_template":"AP_DEBUG_ASSERT(!queue->terminated)","reason":"Logs an error when attempting to push a socket to a terminated queue, indicating a race condition where a socket is being added after shutdown began.","resolution":"This may occur during server shutdown. If it happens during normal operation, check for improper shutdown\/restart sequences or threads not properly handling termination signals."},{"function":"ap_queue_push_socket","message_template":"AP_DEBUG_ASSERT(!ap_queue_full(queue))","reason":"Logs an error when attempting to push a socket to a full queue, indicating that the server is receiving more connections than it can process.","resolution":"Increase the queue capacity by adjusting MaxRequestWorkers or related directives in Apache configuration. Consider implementing rate limiting or increasing server resources."},{"function":"ap_queue_push_timer","message_template":"AP_DEBUG_ASSERT(!queue->terminated)","reason":"Logs an error when attempting to push a timer event to a terminated queue, indicating a race condition during shutdown.","resolution":"This may occur during server shutdown. If it happens during normal operation, investigate potential thread synchronization issues or premature termination of queue components."},{"function":"ap_queue_info_wait_for_idler","message_template":"negative value","reason":"This indicates the queue_info->idlers has a value below zero_pt, meaning there are threads blocked waiting for idle workers, suggesting server overload.","resolution":"Increase the number of worker threads or reduce the incoming request rate. Consider tuning MaxRequestWorkers, ServerLimit, and related MPM configuration directives."},{"function":"ap_queue_pop_something","message_template":"APR_EOF","reason":"Returns when the queue is terminated and empty, indicating normal shutdown or forced termination of the server.","resolution":"This is informational during normal shutdown. If unexpected, check for premature server termination signals or improper shutdown sequences."},{"function":"ap_queue_pop_something","message_template":"APR_EINTR","reason":"Returns when the thread waiting for queue items is interrupted but the queue is still empty, indicating a potential signal interruption.","resolution":"Usually harmless as the thread will typically retry. If frequent, investigate signal handling in the system and potential sources of interruption to Apache worker threads."},{"function":"ap_queue_info_try_get_idler","message_template":"APR_EAGAIN","reason":"Returns when no idle worker is available without blocking, indicating a temporarily busy server.","resolution":"This is normal during high load.

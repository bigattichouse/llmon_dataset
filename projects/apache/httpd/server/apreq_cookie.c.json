{"module":"apreq_cookie.c","summary":"This module handles HTTP cookie processing for Apache Request Library (apreq), providing functionality for creating, parsing, and serializing cookies. It supports both Netscape and RFC-compliant cookie formats with various attributes like path, domain, expiration, and security flags.","logs":[{"function":"apreq_cookie_attr","message_template":"APR_EBADARG","reason":"Cookie attribute name is too short (less than 2 characters). Likely caused by malformed cookie headers or programming error when creating cookies.","resolution":"Check cookie formation in client code or validate cookie strings before processing."},{"function":"apreq_cookie_attr","message_template":"APREQ_ERROR_BADSEQ","reason":"Invalid version value in cookie - cannot find a digit in the version string. Likely due to malformed cookies from clients.","resolution":"Implement more robust cookie validation or error handling for malformed cookies."},{"function":"apreq_cookie_attr","message_template":"APR_ENOTIMPL","reason":"Attempt to set an unsupported cookie attribute.

{"module":"apreq_error.c","summary":"This module provides error handling functionality for the Apache Request (apreq) library, mapping error status codes to human-readable error messages. It includes the apreq_strerror function which returns appropriate error strings for apreq-specific errors or delegates to apr_strerror for handling other types of errors.","logs":[{"function":"apreq_error_string","message_template":"Internal apreq error","reason":"Indicates a general internal error within the apreq library. This may occur due to unexpected conditions or bugs in the code.","resolution":"Check application logs for more context. This is a generic error that might require code inspection or debugging to identify the specific issue."},{"function":"apreq_error_string","message_template":"Attempt to perform unsafe action with tainted data","reason":"The system detected an attempt to use tainted or untrusted data in an operation that requires sanitized input, likely a security protection mechanism.","resolution":"Review input validation and sanitization procedures. Ensure all user input is properly validated before processing."},{"function":"apreq_error_string","message_template":"Malformed input data","reason":"The input data provided to a function does not conform to the expected format or structure, causing parsing or processing failure.","resolution":"Verify the format of input data. Check for correct syntax, encoding, or structure depending on the context of the operation."},{"function":"apreq_error_string","message_template":"Invalid character","reason":"A character in the input data is not valid in the current context, potentially causing parsing errors or security issues.","resolution":"Check input data for forbidden or unexpected characters. Ensure proper input validation and character encoding."},{"function":"apreq_error_string","message_template":"Invalid byte sequence","reason":"The input contains a sequence of bytes that is not valid, often related to character encoding issues or binary data interpretation.","resolution":"Verify character encoding of input data. Ensure the system and input are using compatible character encodings and proper conversion is taking place."},{"function":"apreq_error_string","message_template":"Unrecognized attribute","reason":"An attribute or parameter name was not recognized by the parser or processing function, indicating a configuration or input error.","resolution":"Check attribute names against documented valid options. Update configuration or input data to use only supported attributes."},{"function":"apreq_error_string","message_template":"Malformed header string","reason":"A HTTP header or similar structured string was not properly formatted according to protocol requirements.","resolution":"Ensure headers follow the proper format (field-name: field-value). Check for invalid characters or syntax in header fields."},{"function":"apreq_error_string","message_template":"Missing input data","reason":"Expected input data was not provided to a function or component, likely causing an operation to fail due to lack of required information.","resolution":"Ensure all required input is provided. Check for null or empty values in required fields or parameters."},{"function":"apreq_error_string","message_template":"Expected token not present","reason":"A parser or lexer was expecting a specific token or delimiter in the input that was not found, indicating malformed input.","resolution":"Check input syntax against the expected format. Ensure all required delimiters or tokens are present in the input data."},{"function":"apreq_error_string","message_template":"Missing attribute","reason":"A required attribute or parameter was not provided in the input, causing a process or validation to fail.","resolution":"Ensure all required attributes are included in the request or configuration. Check documentation for mandatory fields."},{"function":"apreq_error_string","message_template":"Missing header","reason":"A required HTTP header was not present in a request or response, potentially causing protocol-level issues.","resolution":"Include all required headers in HTTP requests or responses. Check the protocol requirements for the specific operation being performed."},{"function":"apreq_error_string","message_template":"Missing parser","reason":"A parser component required to process input data was not available or not configured, preventing input processing.","resolution":"Verify the parser configuration and availability. Ensure the appropriate parser module is loaded and properly configured."},{"function":"apreq_error_string","message_template":"Conflicting information","reason":"Contradictory or inconsistent data was provided, making it impossible to determine the correct action or configuration.","resolution":"Review configuration settings for conflicts. Ensure input parameters or configuration options do not contradict each other."},{"function":"apreq_error_string","message_template":"Exceeds configured maximum limit","reason":"A resource limit (such as file size, request size, or number of parameters) was exceeded, triggering a safety mechanism.","resolution":"Either increase the configured limits if the large values are legitimate, or investigate why the input is exceeding normal limits, which could indicate abuse."},{"function":"apreq_error_string","message_template":"Setting already configured","reason":"An attempt was made to configure a setting that has already been set, potentially indicating a configuration conflict or programming error.","resolution":"Check for duplicate configuration settings. Ensure settings are only configured once or implement proper override mechanisms."},{"function":"apreq_error_string","message_template":"Error string not yet specified by apreq","reason":"An error code was encountered for which no specific error message has been defined in the apreq library, typically for new or uncommon errors.","resolution":"Check for newer versions of the library that might include this error code. Report the issue to developers if it occurs frequently."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

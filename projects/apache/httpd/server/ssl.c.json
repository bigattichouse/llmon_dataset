{"module":"ssl.c","summary":"This module implements Apache's SSL\/TLS server infrastructure by providing hooks and API functions for SSL\/TLS functionality. It serves as a bridge between SSL implementation modules (like mod_ssl) and the Apache core, enabling SSL connection handling and HTTPS support.","logs":[{"function":"ap_ssl_bind_outgoing","message_template":"failed to enable ssl support [Hint: if using mod_ssl, see SSLProxyEngine]","reason":"This error occurs when Apache attempts to enable SSL\/TLS support for an outgoing connection but none of the registered SSL modules can successfully handle the request. Likely due to missing SSL module configuration or the required SSL module not being loaded.","resolution":"Ensure mod_ssl or another SSL module is properly loaded and configured. If using mod_ssl, enable the SSLProxyEngine directive in the appropriate configuration context. Check that all required SSL certificates and keys are properly configured and accessible."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

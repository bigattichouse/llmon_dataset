{"module":"apreq_util.c","summary":"This module provides utility functions for the Apache Request library (APREQ), including URL encoding\/decoding, character set detection, temporary file handling, string manipulation, and multi-part form data processing for HTTP requests.","logs":[{"function":"url_decode","message_template":"APREQ_ERROR_BADSEQ","reason":"Indicates a malformed URL-encoded sequence was encountered during decoding, such as an incomplete '%XX' sequence.","resolution":"Check that the URL-encoded data is properly formatted and not truncated. Review the client that generated the request for encoding issues."},{"function":"url_decode","message_template":"APREQ_ERROR_BADCHAR","reason":"Indicates an invalid character was encountered during URL decoding, possibly a zero byte or other illegal character.","resolution":"Review the data being submitted to ensure it contains valid URL-encoded characters. May indicate an attempted security breach or corrupted input."},{"function":"apreq_header_attribute","message_template":"APREQ_ERROR_NOATTR","reason":"Indicates the requested attribute was not found in the HTTP header being parsed.","resolution":"Verify the attribute name is correct and that the client is sending the expected headers. May be an expected condition if the attribute is optional."},{"function":"apreq_header_attribute","message_template":"APREQ_ERROR_BADATTR","reason":"Indicates a malformed attribute in an HTTP header, such as a name with no value or invalid format.","resolution":"Investigate the client that generated the HTTP request, as it may be sending improperly formatted headers. Could indicate a non-compliant user agent."},{"function":"apreq_header_attribute","message_template":"APREQ_ERROR_BADCHAR","reason":"Indicates an invalid character in an HTTP header attribute, such as a control character.","resolution":"Check for malicious clients attempting header injection or similar attacks. Ensure proper input validation is performed on the client side."},{"function":"apreq_file_mktemp","message_template":"APR_SUCCESS","reason":"Indicates successful creation of a temporary file for processing form data or uploads.","resolution":"Informational log, no resolution required.

If occurring unexpectedly, check for premature connection termination or data corruption."},{"function":"apreq_file_cleanup","message_template":"Error removing temporary file","reason":"Could indicate a failure to clean up temporary files after processing, potentially due to permission issues or file system problems.","resolution":"Check file system permissions, disk space, and handle limits. May require manual cleanup of temporary files if occurring frequently."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

{"module":"mod_etag.c","summary":"This module manages the generation of ETags for HTTP responses in Apache HTTP Server. It creates ETags based on file attributes like inode number, size, and modification time, or by generating a SHA1 digest of file content. ETags are used for caching and validation of HTTP resources.","logs":[{"function":"make_digest_etag","message_template":"Make etag: could not open %s","reason":"This error occurs when the function fails to open a file specified by pathname for creating a digest-based ETag. Likely due to file permissions, non-existent file, or file system issues.","resolution":"Check file permissions and existence. Ensure the Apache process has read access to the file. Look for file system issues or corrupted file structure."},{"function":"make_digest_etag","message_template":"Make etag: could not seek","reason":"This error occurs when the function fails to perform a seek operation on the file (getting current position). Likely due to file corruption or file system issues.","resolution":"Check the file system for corruption. Verify that the file is a regular file and not a special file type like a pipe. Ensure the file isn't being modified by another process simultaneously."},{"function":"make_digest_etag","message_template":"Make etag: could not seek","reason":"This error occurs when the function fails to seek to the end of the file to determine its length. May indicate file system issues or file corruption.","resolution":"Verify file system integrity. Check if the file size is changing while being processed. Consider disabling ETags for problematic files or directories."},{"function":"make_digest_etag","message_template":"Make etag: could not seek","reason":"This error occurs when the function fails to seek back to the beginning of the file to read its contents. Could indicate file system issues or concurrent file modifications.","resolution":"Check for concurrent access to the file. Verify file system functionality. Consider using a different ETag generation method by adjusting the FileETag directive."},{"function":"make_digest_etag","message_template":"Make etag: could not read","reason":"This error occurs when reading the file content fails during ETag generation. May indicate file permission changes, file deletion, or I\/O errors while reading.","resolution":"Verify file permissions haven't changed during processing. Check disk health if this error occurs frequently. Consider using file attribute based ETags instead of content digest by configuring FileETag."},{"function":"make_digest_etag","message_template":"Make etag: could not seek","reason":"This error occurs when the function fails to seek back to the original position in the file after reading its content. Indicates file system issues or concurrent file modification.","resolution":"Check for applications that might be modifying the file while Apache is serving it. Consider using the 'FileETag none' directive if problems persist with specific files or directories."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

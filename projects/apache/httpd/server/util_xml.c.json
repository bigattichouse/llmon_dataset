It reads and parses the XML body of incoming requests, enforcing configured size limits and handling XML parsing errors appropriately.","logs":[{"function":"ap_xml_parse_input","message_template":"XML request body is larger than the configured limit of %lu","reason":"This error is logged when a client submits an XML request body that exceeds the server's configured size limit. Likely due to an intentionally or unintentionally large request payload.","resolution":"Increase the LimitXMLRequestBody directive value in your Apache configuration if legitimate requests need to be larger. Otherwise, this may indicate an attempted DoS attack or client misconfiguration."},{"function":"ap_xml_parse_input","message_template":"XML parser error (at end). status=%d","reason":"This error occurs when the XML parser encounters an error after receiving the complete document. This could be due to malformed XML or an incomplete document.","resolution":"Check client applications sending XML to ensure they are generating valid XML. The status code in the log can help identify the specific parsing error from the XML library."},{"function":"ap_xml_parse_input","message_template":"XML Parser Error: %s","reason":"This error occurs during XML parsing when the parser encounters a syntax error or other XML-related issue. The detailed error message is included.","resolution":"Examine the detailed error message to identify the specific XML problem. Ensure clients are sending well-formed XML that meets the expected schema or format."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

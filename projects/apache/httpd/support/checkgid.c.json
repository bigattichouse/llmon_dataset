{"module":"groupcheck.c","summary":"A utility program that validates whether specified group identifiers (names or numeric IDs) can be used by the Apache HTTP server at runtime. It checks if each group exists in the system and if the process can successfully switch to that group via setgid().","logs":[{"function":"main","message_template":"%s: group '%s' not found\n","reason":"This error occurs when the specified group name or ID cannot be found in the system's group database. Likely due to a mistyped group name or a group that doesn't exist on the current system.","resolution":"Verify the group name exists on the target system by checking \/etc\/group or equivalent. If using a numeric group ID, ensure it corresponds to a valid group. Consider creating the required group on the system or modifying the Apache configuration to use an existing group."},{"function":"main","message_template":"%s: invalid group '%s'\n","reason":"This error occurs when the process cannot switch to the specified group via setgid(), even though the group exists. Likely due to insufficient permissions (not running as root) or system security policies preventing the operation.","resolution":"Ensure the utility is run with superuser privileges (root) to allow the setgid() operation to succeed. Check system security policies like SELinux that might be preventing group changes. Verify the group has appropriate permissions for the Apache server's needs."},{"function":"main","message_template":"perror(argv[0])","reason":"This system error message provides additional details about why the setgid() operation failed, such as 'Operation not permitted' or 'Permission denied'.","resolution":"Address the specific system error reported. Most commonly, run the utility as root to allow group changes. If other errors occur, they may indicate system-level configuration issues that need to be addressed by a system administrator."}],"project":"apache\/httpd"}

{"module":"fcgistarter.c","summary":"The fcgistarter utility is an Apache module that starts FastCGI processes on specific ports and interfaces. It handles command-line arguments to configure the FastCGI server, creates a socket, binds it to the specified interface and port, and then forks child processes to run the FastCGI application.","logs":[{"function":"usage","message_template":"usage: fcgistarter -c <command> -p <port> [-i <interface> -N <num>]\n\nIf an interface is not specified, any available will be used.\n","reason":"Displayed when the user provides incorrect command-line arguments or missing required parameters","resolution":"Provide the correct command-line arguments as specified in the usage message, ensuring that at least a command (-c) and port (-p) are specified"},{"function":"exit_error","message_template":"%s: %s\n","reason":"Generic error reporting function that outputs the name of the failed function and the error message","resolution":"Resolution depends on the specific error reported, but generally involves checking system resources, permissions, and network configuration"},{"function":"main","message_template":"apr_sockaddr_info_get","reason":"Failed to get socket address information for the specified interface and port","resolution":"Verify that the specified interface exists and is available on the system. Check that the port number is valid and not already in use"},{"function":"main","message_template":"apr_socket_create","reason":"Failed to create a socket with the specified parameters","resolution":"Check system resources (file descriptors) and network stack configuration.

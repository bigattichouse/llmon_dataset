###Project Files

Each project here is a user/repo associated with a mapped project, for example "apache/httpd". We should probably include software versions or commits somehow.

Within each project will be a directory structure mapping to all the source code files.

Each source file in the parent project will be mapped to a related file in the JSON files

For example: somemodule.c will map to somemodule.c.log.json

***

Each file contains a JSON structure showing potential errors that might be thrown that may show up in syslog or journalctl, including the function, a prototype of the error, and üçã-LLMon determined reason for the error. Additionally, we'll include embeddings - I hope to create a hash system to shorthand embeddings into something less numerical.

I'd also like to add potential

###Example with some possible future enhancements

```module.c.json 
  {
    "function": "proxy_connect_handler",
    "message_template": "tunnel timed out",
    "reason": "Logs an error when the tunnel operation times out."
    "*resolution": "Possible network configuration error or incorrect host"
    "**vector":"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"
  }

```

*resolution is something I'm trying to get the llm to do reliably, it may have to be added later in a second step

**I'm working to create a "Hash" sort of representation of an embedding vector that can be easily translated.  The placeholder text is just Base64 encoded Lorem Ipsum.
